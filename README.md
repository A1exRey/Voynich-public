Corpus materials to accompany Character Entropy in Modern and Historical Texts: Comparison Metrics for an Undeciphered Manuscript (Lindemann &amp; Bowern).

The cleaned corpus files and statistic summaries are in the Corpus folder.

The Python code folder contains code for processing Wikipedia bzip2 files. 

The R code folder contains code for processing and cleaning the corpora texts. Due to size limitations, it does not contain the raw Wikipedia texts or the processed texts themselves.
