the greatest figures of the twentieth century a brilliant mathematician and cryptographer alan was to become the founder of modern day computer science and artificial intelligence designing a machine at bletchley park to break secret enigma encrypted messages used by the nazi german war machine to protect sensitive commercial diplomatic and military communications during world war thus turing made the single biggest contribution to the allied victory in the war against nazi germany possibly saving the lives of an estimated million people through his effort in shortening world war ii in almost years later turing received a posthumous royal pardon from queen elizabeth ii today the turing law grants an automatic pardon to men who died before the law came into force making it possible for living convicted gay men to seek pardons for offences now no longer on the statute book alas turing accidentally or otherwise lost his life in having been subjected by a british court to chemical castration thus avoiding a custodial sentence he is known to have ended his life at the age of years by eating an apple laced with cyanide career turing was one of the people who worked on the first computers he created the theoretical turing machine in the machine was imaginary but it included the idea of a computer program turing was interested in artificial intelligence he proposed the turing

supported it a royal pardon was granted on december death in turing died from cyanide poisoning the cyanide came from either an apple which was poisoned with cyanide or from water that had cyanide in it the reason for the confusion is that the police never tested the apple for cyanide it is also suspected that he committed suicide the treatment forced on him is now believed to be very wrong it is against medical ethics and international laws of human rights in august a petition asking the british government to apologise to turing for punishing him for being a homosexual was started the

people for food and raw materials farming is a part of agriculture agriculture started thousands of years ago but no one knows for sure how old it is the development of farming gave rise to the neolithic revolution whereby people gave up nomadic hunting and became settlers in what became cities agriculture and domestication probably started in the fertile crescent the nile valley the levant and mesopotamia the area called fertile crescent is now in the countries of iraq syria turkey jordan lebanon israel and egypt wheat and barley are some of the first crops people grew people probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops but still gathered many foods from the wild people may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change farming can feed many more people than hunter gatherers can feed on the same amount of land kinds of farming agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals but also growing other things like flowers and nursery plants manure or dung animal hides skins or furs leather animals fungi fibers cotton wool hemp and flax biofuels and drugs biopharmaceuticals marijuana opium many people still live by subsistence agriculture on a small farm they can only grow enough food to feed the farmer his family and his animals the yield is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land and it is often low this is because subsistence farmers are generally less educated and they have less money to buy equipment drought and other problems sometimes cause famines where yields are low deforestation can provide new land to grow more food this provides more nutrition for the farmer s family but can be bad for the country and the surrounding environment over many years in rich countries farms are often fewer and larger during the th century they have become more productive because farmers are able to grow better varieties of plants use more fertilizer use more water and more easily control weeds and pests many farms also use machines so fewer people can farm more land there are fewer farmers in rich countries but the farmers are able to grow more this kind of intensive agriculture comes with its own set of problems farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers pesticides chemicals that kill bugs and herbicides chemicals that kill weeds these chemicals can pollute the soil or the water they can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals causing outbreaks of these pests the soil can be damaged by erosion blowing or washing away salt buildup or loss of structure irrigation adding water from rivers can pollute water and lower the water table these problems have all got solutions and modern young farmers usually have a good technical education agriculture techniques fertilizers crop rotation weed removal breeding fencing ranching plantation farmers select plants with better yield taste and nutritional value they also choose plants that can survive plant disease and drought and are easier to harvest centuries of artificial selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants the crops produce better yield with other techniques use of fertilizers chemical pest control irrigation some companies have been searching for new plants in poor countries and genetically modify these plants to improve them they then try to patent the seeds and sell them back to the poor countries new plants were created with genetic engineering one example of genetic engineering is modifying a plant to resist a herbicide food it is important for there to be enough food for everyone the food must also be safe and good people say it is not always safe because it contains some chemicals other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment for this reason there are several types of agriculture traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries intensive agriculture is mostly done in countries with more money it uses pesticides machinery chemical fertilizers organic farming is using only natural products such as compost and green manure integrated farming is using local resources and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process agricultural policy focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production common goals of policy include the quality amount and safety of food problems in agriculture there are some serious problems that people face trying to grow food today these include erosion diseases pests weeds drought rainfall crops the major crops produced in the world in are maize corn wheat rice and cotton maize million metric tons wheat million metric tons rice million metric tons cotton million metric tons see also list of vegetables list of herbs list

subtraction multiplication and division harder arithmetic includes working with signed numbers fractions and decimals and taking powers and roots most people learn arithmetic in primary school but some people do not learn arithmetic and others forget the arithmetic they learned many jobs require a knowledge of arithmetic and many employers complain that it is hard to find people who know enough arithmetic a few of the many jobs that require arithmetic include carpenters plumbers auto mechanics accountants architects doctors and nurses arithmetic is needed in all areas of mathematics science and engineering a calculator can be used to do arithmetic computers can do it more quickly which is one reason global positioning system receivers have a small computer inside examples of arithmetic adding is commutative is the same as subtracting is not commutative is different from multiplying is commutative is the same as dividing is not commutative is different from reference article on arithmetic from encyclopedia britannica addition addition is a mathematical way of putting things together arithmetic in arithmetic addition is finding the total of two or more numbers the sign for addition is the name for the sign is plus another name for the total is the sum counting examples for example there are objects in two groups the objects are small circles o one group has five of these objects the other group has of these objects to find the total number of objects in both groups the objects can be counted another way to find the number of objects in both groups is to add the numbers in each group adding another method is to add the numbers of objects in group a and group b since they are already counted in symbols there are rules for adding numbers that people learn there are also rules for adding numbers that are built into machines binary adder the rule says that in another counting example sally and bill have children sally and bill get more children sally and bill have added three children to their two children and now have five children vertical addition the animation above demonstrates the addition of seven hundred and eighty six and four hundred and sixty seven the problems digits have been separated into units tens and hundreds place value first the units and are added together to make so ten and units the is written below and the ten is carried to the tens column next in the tens column the and are added together to make tens so hundred and tens the is written below and the hundred is carried to the hundreds column finally in the hundreds column and are added together to make hundreds so thousand and hundreds the is written below and the thousand is carried to the thousand column giving the answer one thousand two hundred and fifty three a measurement example tom wants to know the distance between his house and sally s house bob s house is meters east of tom s house sally s house is meters east of bob s house tom s housebob s housesally s house the distance from tom s house to sally s house can be found by adding the distances already measured the distance from tom s house to bob s house added to the distance from bob s house to sally s house is the same as the distance from tom s house to sally s house that is three hundred meters plus meters addition as increase addition can also mean to make bigger example of addition as increase for example tom has a house tom puts a new room on the house this new room is called an addition john is making food to make the food taste better john puts salt in the food that is john adds salt to the food the salt is a food additive or addition to the food addition table other websites aaa math web page on teaching addition addition flashcard website addition facts and

continents of the world many millions of years ago because of this many animals and plants live in australia that do not live anywhere else these include animals like the kangaroo the koala the emu the kookaburra and the platypus people first arrived in australia more than years ago these native australians are called the australian aborigines for the history of australia see history of australia most of the australian colonies having been settled from britain became mostly independent democratic states in the s and all six combined as a federation on january the first prime minister of australia was edmund barton in australia is a member of the united nations and the commonwealth of nations it is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy with elizabeth ii as queen of australia and head of state and a governor general who is chosen by the prime minister to carry out all the duties of the queen in australia regions and cities australia has six states two major

perth darwin hobart and adelaide the largest inland city is canberra which is also the nation s capital the largest city is sydney australia is a very big country but much of the land is very dry and the middle of the continent is mostly desert only the areas around the east west and south coast have enough rain and a suitable climate not too hot for many farms and cities history aboriginal people photograph of arrernte men of central australia in a corroboree in the australian aboriginal people arrived in australia about years ago or even earlier until the arrival of british settlers in the aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land they lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways an example of aboriginal land management was the cumberland plain where sydney is now every few years the aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees this meant that a lot of grass grew back but not many big trees kangaroos like to live on grassy plains but not in forests the kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the aboriginal people sometimes aborigines would name a person after an animal and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population aboriginal people did not usually build houses except huts of grass leaves and bark they did not usually build walls or fences and there were no horses cows or sheep in australia that needed to be kept in pens the only aboriginal buildings that are known are fish traps made from stones piled up in the river and the remains of a few stone huts in victoria and tasmania the aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth in some parts of australia the people used sharp flaked stone spearheads but most aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making the boomerang was used in some areas for sport and for hunting the aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them they believed that they had grown from the land so it was like their mother and they belonged to the land terra australis in the s dutch merchants traded with the islands of batavia now indonesia to the north of australia and several different dutch ships touched on the coast of australia the dutch governor van diemen sent abel tasman on a voyage of discovery and he found tasmania which he named van diemen s land its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it the british government was sure that there must be a very large land in the south that had not been explored they sent captain james cook to the pacific ocean his ship hms endeavour carried the famous scientists sir joseph banks and dr solander who were going to tahiti where they would watch the planet venus pass in front of the sun captain cook s secret mission was to find terra australis the land of the south the voyage of discovery was very successful because they found new zealand and sailed right around it then they sailed westward at last a boy william hicks who was up the mast spotted land on the horizon captain cook named that bit of land point hicks they sailed up the coast and captain cook named the land that he saw new south wales at last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food joseph banks and dr solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were they collected hundreds of plants to take back to england captain cook saw the aboriginal people with their simple way of life he saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit but there were no houses and no fences in most parts of the world people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land but the aboriginal people did not own the land in that way they belonged to the land like a baby belongs to its mother captain cook went home to england and told the government that no one owned the land this would later cause a terrible problem for the aboriginal people settlement captain arthur phillip raises the british flag at sydney in in the s in england laws were tough many people were poor and gaols jails were full a person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread many people were hung for small crimes but usually they were just thrown in gaol often they were sent away to the british colonies in america but by the s the colonies in america became the united states they were free from british rule and would not take england s convicts any more so england needed to find a new and less populated place by the s the gaols of england were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships the government decided to make a settlement in new south wales and send some of the convicts there in the first fleet of eleven ships set sail from portsmouth carrying convicts sailors marines a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years their leader was captain arthur phillip they were to make a new colony at the place that captain cook had discovered named botany bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists captain phillip found that botany bay was flat and windy there was not much fresh water he went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbor which he said was the finest harbor in the world there were many small bays on the harbor so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on on january the flag was raised and new south wales was claimed in the name of king george iii of england and the new settlement was called sydney for the first few years of the settlement things were very difficult no one in the british government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony nobody had chosen them carefully there was only one man who was a farmer there was no one among the convicts who was a builder a brick maker or a blacksmith no one knew how to fix the tools when they broke all of the cattle escaped there were no cooking pots all the plants were different so no one knew which ones could be eaten it was probable that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation somehow the little group of tents with a hut for the governor arthur phillip and another hut for the supply of food grew into a small town with streets a bridge over the stream a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships by the s there was a fine brick house for the governor there was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today settlements had spread out from sydney firstly to norfolk island and to van diemen s land tasmania and also up the coast to newcastle where coal was discovered and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd spanish merino sheep had been brought to sydney and by farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of england while the settlement was growing in new south wales it was also growing in tasmania the climate in tasmania was more like that in england and farmers found it easy to grow crops there exploration governor lachlan macquarie was the th governor of new south wales and one who though that australia could be a rich and free place because australia is such a very large land it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people in the early days of the colony a great number of explorers went out searching for good land to settle on when the settlers looked west from sydney they saw a range of mountains which they called the blue mountains they were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years no one could find their way through them in gregory blaxland william lawson and a year old called william charles wentworth crossed the blue mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming a road was built and the governor lachlan macquarie founded the town of bathurst on the other side miles from sydney some people like captain charles sturt were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of australia and set out to find it many of the explorers did not prepare very well or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year some died like burke and wills ludwig leichhardt got lost twice the second time he was never seen again major thomas mitchell was one of the most successful explorers he mapped the country as he went and his maps remained in use for more than years he travelled all the way to what is now western victoria and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there the henty brothers had come from tasmania had built themselves a house had a successful farm and fed the major and his men on roast lamb and wine self government the gold rushes of new south wales and victoria started in leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold the population grew across south east australia and made great wealth and industry by the gold rushes had made some poor people very rich the transportation of convicts to australia ended in the s and s and more changes came the people in australia wanted to run their own country and not be told what to do from london the first governments in the colonies were run by governors chosen by london soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy william wentworth started the australian patriotic association australia s first political party in to demand democratic government in the city councils started and some people could vote new south wales legislative council had its first elections in again with some limits on who could vote in limited self government was given by london to new south wales victoria south australia and tasmania in the right to vote was given to all men over in south australia the other colonies soon followed women were given the vote in the parliament of south australia in and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections australians had started parliamentary democracies all across the continent but voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament the commonwealth of australia a painting of the opening of the first parliament of australia may painted by tom roberts australia has had democracy since the s countries of birth of australian estimated resident population source australian bureau of statistics until australia was not a nation it was six separate colonies governed by britain they voted to join together to form one new country called the commonwealth of australia in australia was still part of the british empire and at first wanted only british

labor party australia passed many laws to help the workers in the first world war started in europe australia joined in on the side of britain against germany austria hungary and the ottoman empire

lots of australian soldiers were captured in the fall of singapore by japan then japan started attacking australia and people worried about invasion but with help from the united states navy the japanese were stopped after the war australia became a close friend of the united states when the war ended australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work so the

singing and praising god they can shout so loud they shake the temple archangels like gabriel gospel of luke are the highest type of angel they are considered saints in the catholic church however in the king james version of the bible they are another type of angel in the book of revelation the angel michael casts the great dragon satan out of heaven and down to earth in a great battle between the good and bad angels just before the great judgement of angels and man revelation the leviathan in book of job has flame that goes out of his mouth like a dragon isaiah also talks of a fiery flying serpent compare revelation where an angel laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan and bound him a thousand years in art they are often shown in art as having wings and a halo the wings represent their speed and the halo represents their holiness the cherubim in art always appear as baby faced angels with very small non useful wings the cherubim statue or bronze

english ad hominem means against the person in other words when someone makes an ad hominem they are attacking the person they are arguing against instead of what they are saying the term comes from the latin word homo which means human hominem is a gender neutral version of the word homo in ancient rome it referred to all free men or in other words all free human beings ad hominem can be a way to use reputation rumors and hearsay to change the minds of other people listening when a social network has already excluded or exiled one person or applied a negative label to them this can work more often it is most of the time considered to be a weak and poor argument in courts and in diplomacy ad hominems are not appreciated ad hominems are not wrong every time for example when people think that someone can t be trusted things that they have said previously can be doubted what an ad hominem argument looks like in logic a proof is something that starts with premises and goes through a few logical arguments to reach a conclusion normal valid proof all humans are mortal socrates is human therefore socrates is mortal ad hominem example person a thinks abortion should be illegal person a is uneducated and poor therefore abortion should not be illegal in this example it can be seen that the completely unrelated fact that person a is uneducated and poor is used to prove that

indians amerindians or indigenous peoples of america are the people and their descendants who were in the americas when europeans arrived there are many different tribes of native american people with many different languages there are more than three million native americans in canada and the u s combined about million native americans live in latin america sometimes these people are called indians but this is confusing because it is the same word used for people from india when christopher columbus explored he did not know about the americas he was in the caribbean but thought he was in the east indies so he called the people indians many native americans died after the europeans came to the americas from diseases that came with the europeans that were new to the native americans in battle with the europeans or because the europeans made them work as slaves most of the native people were hurt or killed by settlers who took their lands the ancestors of native americans came to the

is considered to be a worldwide low cost fruit harvest able all over the world the tree originated in central asia apples have been grown for thousands of years in asia and europe they were brought to north america by european settlers apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures apples are generally propagated by grafting although wild apples grow readily from seed apple trees are large if grown from seed but small if grafted onto roots rootstock there are more than known cultivars of apples with a range of desired characteristics different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses cooking eating raw and cider production are the most common uses trees and fruit are attacked by fungi bacteria and pests in the fruit s genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production worldwide production of apples in was million tonnes china grew of the total botanical information the apple has a small leaf shedding tree that grows up to tall the apple tree has a broad crown with thick twigs the leaves are alternately arranged simple ovals they are to centimetres long and centimetres in wide it has a sharp top with a soft underside blossoms come out in spring at the same time that the leaves begin to bud the flowers are white they also have a slightly pink color they are five petaled and to centimetres to in in diameter the fruit matures in autumn it is usually to centimetres to in in diameter there are five carpels arranged in a star in the middle of the fruit every carpel has one to three seeds wild malus sieversii apple in kazakhstan wild ancestors the wild ancestor of apple trees is malus sieversii they grow wild in the mountains of central asia in the north of kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan and xinjiang china and possibly also malus sylvestris unlike domesticated apples their leaves become red in autumn they are being used recently to develop malus domestica to grow in colder climates history the apple tree was possibly the earliest tree to be cultivated its fruits have become better over thousands of years it is said that alexander the great discovered dwarf apples in asia minor in bc asia and europe have used winter apples as an important food for thousands of years from when europeans arrived argentina and the united states have used apples as food as well apples were brought to north america in the s the first apple orchard on the north american continent was said to be near boston in in the s costly fruit industries where the apple was a very important species began developing in culture paganism iduna by carl larsson in norse mythology the goddess iunn gives apples to the gods in prose edda written in the th century by snorri sturluson that makes them young forever english scholar h r ellis davidson suggests that apples were related to religious practices in germanic paganism it was from there she claims that norse paganism developed she points out that buckets of apples were discovered in the place of burial for the oseberg ship in norway she also remarks that fruit and nuts iunn having been described as changing into a nut in skldskaparml have been discovered in the early graves of the germanic peoples in england they have also been discovered somewhere else on the continent of europe she suggests that this may have had a symbolic meaning nuts are still a symbol of fertility in southwest england cooking sometimes apples are eaten after they are cooked often apples are eaten uncooked apples can also be made into drinks apple juice and apple cider are apple drinks the flesh of the fruit is firm with a taste anywhere from sour to sweet apples used for cooking are sour and need to be cooked with sugar while other apples are sweet and do not need cooking there are some seeds at the core that can be removed with a tool that removes the core or by carefully using a knife the scientific name of the apple tree genus in the latin language is malus most apples that people grow are of the malus domestica species most apples are good to eat raw not cooked and are also used in many kinds of baked foods such as apple pie apples are cooked until they are soft to make apple sauce apples are also made into the drinks apple juice and cider usually cider contains a little alcohol about as much as beer the regions of brittany in france and cornwall in england are known for their apple ciders apple cultivars if one wants to grow a certain type of apple it is not possible to do this by planting a seed from the wanted type the seed will have dna from the apple that the seeds came from but it will also have dna from the apple flower that pollinated the seeds which may well be a different type this means that the tree which would grow from planting would be a mixture of two in order to grow a certain type of apple a small twig or scion is cut from the tree that grows the type of apple desired and then added on to a specially grown stump called a rootstock the tree that grows will only create apples of the type needed there are more than known cultivars of apples different cultivars are available for temperate and subtropical climates one large collection of over apple cultivars is at the national fruit collection in england most of these cultivars are grown for eating fresh dessert apples however some are grown simply for cooking or making cider cider apples are usually too tart to eat immediately however they give cider a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot most popular apple cultivars are soft but crisp colorful skin easy shipping disease resistance red delicious apple shape and popular flavor are also needed modern apples are usually sweeter than older cultivars this is because popular tastes in apples have become different most north americans and europeans enjoy sweet apples extremely sweet apples with hardly any acid taste are popular in asia and india in the united kingdom in the united kingdom there are about different types of apples the most common apple type grown in england is the bramley seedling which is a popular cooking apple apple orchards are not as common as they were in the early s when apples were rarely brought in from other countries organizations such as common ground teach people about the importance of rare and local varieties of fruit apple day is celebrated each october in many countries in north america many apples are grown in temperate parts of the united states and canada in many areas where apple growing is important

rules that they have to follow algebra is a part of mathematics often called math in the united states and maths or numeracy in the united kingdom it uses variables to represent a value that is not yet known when an equals sign is used this is called an equation a very simple equation using a variable is x in this example x or it could also be said x equals five this is called solving for x besides equations there are inequalities less than and greater than a special type of equation is called the function this is often used in making graphs because it always turns one input into one output algebra can be used to solve real problems because the rules of algebra work in real life and numbers can be used to represent the values of real things physics engineering and computer programming are areas that use algebra all the time it is also useful to know in surveying construction and business especially accounting people who do algebra use the rules of numbers and mathematic operations used on numbers the simplest are adding subtracting multiplying and dividing more advanced operations involve exponents starting with squares and square roots algebra was first used to solve equations and inequalities two examples are linear equations the equation of a straight line y mx b and quadratic equations which has variables that are squared multiplied by itself for example or x x history early forms of algebra were developed by the babylonians and the greek geometers such as hero of alexandria however the word algebra is a latin form of the arabic word al jabr casting and comes from a mathematics book al maqala fi hisab al jabr wa al muqabilah essay on the computation of casting and equation written in the th century by a persian mathematician muhammad ibn ms al khwrizm who was a muslim born in khwarizm in uzbekistan he flourished under al ma moun in baghdad iraq through ad and died around ad the book was brought into europe and translated into latin in the th century the book was then given the name algebra the ending of the mathematician s name al khwarizmi was changed into a word easier to say in latin and became the english word algorithm examples here is a simple example of an algebra problem sue has candies ann has candies they decide to share so that they have the same number of candies these are the steps you can use to solve the problem to have the same number of candies ann has to give some to sue let x represent the number of candies ann gives to sue sue s candies plus x must be the same as ann s candies minus x this is written as x x subtract from both sides of the equation this gives x x what happens on one side of the equals sign must happen on the other side too for the equation to still be true so in this case when was subtracted from both sides there was a middle step of x x after a person is comfortable with this the middle step is not written down add x to both sides of the equation this gives x divide both sides of the equation by this gives x the answer is six if ann gives sue candies they will have the same number of candies to check this put back into the original equation wherever x was this gives which is true they both now have candies with practice algebra can be used when faced with a problem that is too hard to solve any other way problems such as building a freeway designing a cell phone or finding the cure for a disease all require algebra writing algebra as in most parts of mathematics adding z to y or y plus z is written as y z subtracting z from y or y minus z is written as y z dividing y by z or y over z is written as y z or y z y z is more commonly used in algebra multiplying y by z or y times z can be written in ways y z y z y z or just yz the multiplication symbol is usually not used because it looks too much like the letter x which is often used as a variable also when multiplying a larger expression parentheses can be used y z when we multiply a number and a letter in algebra we write the number in front of the letter y y when the number is then the is not written because times any number is that number y y and so it is not needed as a side note you do not have to use the letters x or y in algebra variables are just symbols that mean some unknown number or value so you can use any variable x and y are the most common though functions and graphs linear equation for y x an important part of algebra is the study of functions since functions often appear in equations that we are trying to solve a function is like a machine you can put a number or numbers into and get a certain number or numbers out when using functions graphs can be powerful tools in helping us to study the solutions to equations a graph is a picture that shows all the values of the variables that make the equation or inequality true usually this is easy to make when there are only one or two variables the graph is often a line and if the line does not bend or go straight up and down it can be described by the basic formula y mx b the variable b is the y intercept of the graph where the line crosses the vertical axis and m is the slope or steepness of the line this formula applies to the coordinates of a graph where each point on the line is written x y in some math problems like the equation for a line there can be more than one variable x and y in this case to find points on the line one variable is changed the variable that is changed is called the independent variable then the math is done to make a number the number that is made is called the dependent variable most of the time the independent variable is written as x and the dependent variable is written as y for example in y x this is often put on a graph using an x axis going left and right and a y axis going up and down it can also be written in function form f x x so in this example we could put in for x and get y put in for x would get y and for x would get y so there would be a line going thru the points and as seen in the graph to the right if x has a power of it is a straight line if it is squared or some other power it will be curved if it uses an inequality then usually part of the graph is shaded either above or below the line rules of algebra in algebra there are a few rules that can be used for further understanding of equations these are called the rules of algebra while these rules may seem senseless or obvious it is wise to understand that these properties do not hold throughout all branches of mathematics therefore it will be useful to know how these axiomatic rules are declared before taking them for granted before going on to the rules reflect on two definitions that will be given opposite the opposite of is reciprocal the reciprocal of is rules commutative property of addition commutative means that a function has the same result if the numbers are swapped around in other words the order of the terms in an equation do not matter when the operator of two terms is an addition the commutative property of addition is applicable in algebraic terms this gives note that this does not apply for subtraction i e commutative property of multiplication when the operator of two terms is an multiplication the commutative property of multiplication is applicable in algebraic terms this gives note that this does not apply for division i e when associative property of addition associative refers to the grouping of numbers the associative property of addition implies that when adding three or more terms it doesn t matter how these terms are grouped algebraically this gives note that this does not hold for subtraction e g see the distributive property associative property of multiplication the associative property of multiplication implies that when multiplying three or more terms it doesn t matter how these terms are grouped algebraically this gives note that this does not hold for division e g distributive property the distributive property states that the multiplication of a number by another term can be distributed for instance do not confuse this with the associative properties for instance additive identity property identity refers to the property of a number that it is equal to itself in other words there exists an operation of two numbers so that it equals the variable of the sum the additive identity property states that the sum of any number and is that number this also holds for subtraction multiplicative identity property the multiplicative identity property states that the product of any number and is that number this also holds for division additive inverse property the additive inverse property is somewhat like the opposite of the additive identity property when an operation is the sum of a number and its opposite and it equals that operation is a valid algebraic operation algebraically it states the following additive inverse of is multiplicative inverse property the multiplicative inverse property entails that when an operation is the product of a number and its reciprocal and it equals that operation is a valid algebraic operation algebraically it states the following multiplicative inverse of is advanced algebra in addition to elementary algebra or basic algebra there are advanced forms of algebra taught in colleges and universities such as abstract algebra linear algebra and universal algebra this includes how to use a matrix to solve many linear equations at once abstract algebra is the study of things that are found in equations going beyond numbers to the more abstract with groups of numbers many math problems are about physics and engineering in many of these physics problems time is a variable time uses the letter t using the basic ideas in algebra can help reduce a math problem to its simplest form making it easier to solve difficult problems energy is e force is f mass is m acceleration is a and speed of light is sometimes c this is used in some famous equations like f ma and e mc although more complex math beyond algebra was needed to come up with that last equation related pages list of mathematics topics order of

algebra free online micro lectures the atom is the basic unit of matter it is the smallest thing that can have a chemical property there are many different types of atoms each with its own name atomic mass and size these different atoms are called chemical elements the chemical elements are organized on the periodic table examples of elements are hydrogen and gold atoms are very small but the exact size depends on the element atoms range from to nanometers in width one nanometer is about times smaller than the width of a human hair this makes atoms impossible to see without special tools scientists use experiments to learn how they work and interact with other atoms atoms join together to make molecules for example two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom combine to make a water molecule when atoms join together it is called a chemical reaction atoms are made up of three kinds of smaller particles called protons which are positively charged neutrons which have no charge and electrons which are negatively charged the protons and neutrons are heavier and stay in the middle of the atom they are called the nucleus they are surrounded by a cloud of electrons which are very lightweight they are attracted to the positive charge of the nucleus by the electromagnetic force the number of protons and electrons an atom has tells us what element it is hydrogen for example has one proton and one electron the element sulfur has protons and electrons the number of protons is the atomic number except for hydrogen the nucleus also has neutrons the number of protons and neutrons together is the atomic weight atoms move faster when they are in their gas form because they are free to move than they do in liquid form and solid matter in solid materials the atoms are tightly packed next to each other so they vibrate but are not able to move there is no room as atoms in liquids do history the word atom comes from the greek atomos indivisible from not and a cut the first historical mention of the word atom came from works by the greek philosopher democritus around bc atomic theory stayed as a mostly philosophical subject with not much actual scientific investigation or study until the development of chemistry in the s in french chemist antoine lavoisier defined the term element for the first time he said that an element was any basic substance that could not be broken down into other substances by the methods of chemistry any substance that could be broken down was a compound in english philosopher john dalton suggested that elements were tiny solid balls made of atoms dalton believed that all atoms of the same element have the same mass he said that compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine according to dalton in a certain compound the atoms of the compound s elements always combine the same way in british scientist robert brown looked at pollen grains in water under his microscope the pollen grains appeared to be jiggling brown used dalton s atomic theory to describe patterns in the way they moved this was called brownian motion in albert einstein used mathematics to prove that the seemingly random movements were caused by the reactions of atoms and by doing this he conclusively proved the existence of the atom in scientist dmitri mendeleev published the first version of the periodic table the periodic table groups elements by their atomic number how many protons they have this is usually the same as the number of electrons elements in the same column or period usually have similar properties for example helium neon argon krypton and xenon are all in the same column and have very similar properties all these elements are gases that have no colour and no smell also they are unable to combine with other atoms to form compounds together they are known as the noble gases the physicist j j thomson was the first person to discover electrons this happened while he was working with cathode rays in he realized they had a negative charge unlike protons positive and neutrons no charge thomson created the plum pudding model which stated that an atom was like plum pudding the dried fruit electrons were stuck in a mass of pudding protons in a scientist named ernest rutherford used the geiger marsden experiment to prove that most of an atom is in a very small space called the atomic nucleus rutherford took a photo plate and covered it with gold foil and then shot alpha particles made of two protons and two neutrons stuck together at it many of the particles went through the gold foil which proved that atoms are mostly empty space electrons are so small they make up only of an atom s mass ernest rutherford in niels bohr introduced the bohr model this model showed that electrons travel around the nucleus in fixed circular orbits this was more accurate than the rutherford model however it was still not completely right improvements to the bohr model have been made since it was first introduced in chemist frederick soddy found that some elements in the periodic table had more than one kind of atom for example any atom with protons should be a helium atom usually a helium nucleus also contains two neutrons however some helium atoms have only one neutron this means they truly are helium because an element is defined by the number of protons but they are not normal helium either soddy called an atom like this with a different number of neutrons an isotope to get the name of the isotope we look at how many protons and neutrons it has in its nucleus and add this to the name of the element so a helium atom with two protons and one neutron is called helium and a carbon atom with six protons and six neutrons is called carbon however when he developed his theory soddy could not be certain neutrons actually existed to prove they were real physicist james chadwick and a team of others created the mass spectrometer the mass spectrometer actually measures the mass and weight of individual atoms by doing this chadwick proved that to account for all the weight of the atom neutrons must exist in german chemist otto hahn became the first person to create nuclear fission in a laboratory he discovered this by chance when he was shooting neutrons at a uranium atom hoping to create a new isotope however he noticed that instead of a new isotope the uranium simply changed into a barium atom a smaller atom than uranium apparently hahn had broken the uranium atom this was the world s first recorded nuclear fission reaction this discovery eventually led to the creation of the atomic bomb further into the th century physicists went deeper into the mysteries of the atom using particle accelerators they discovered that protons and neutrons were actually made of other particles called quarks the most accurate model so far comes from the schrdinger equation schrdinger realized that the electrons exist in a cloud around the nucleus called the electron cloud in the electron cloud it is impossible to know exactly where electrons are the schrdinger equation is used to find out where an electron is likely to be this area is called the electron s orbital structure and parts parts the complex atom is made up of three main particles the proton the neutron and the electron the isotope of hydrogen hydrogen has no neutrons just the one proton and one electron a positive hydrogen ion has no electrons just the one proton and one neutron these two examples are the only known exceptions to the rule that all other atoms have at least one proton one neutron and one electron each electrons are by far the smallest of the three atomic particles their mass and size is too small to be measured using current technology they have a negative charge protons and neutrons are of similar size and weight to each other protons are positively charged and neutrons have no charge most atoms have a neutral charge because the number of protons positive and electrons negative are the same the charges balance out to zero however in ions different number of electrons this is not always the case and they can have a positive or a negative charge protons and neutrons are made out of quarks of two types up quarks and down quarks a proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark and a neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark nucleus the nucleus is in the middle of an atom it is made up of protons and neutrons usually in nature two things with the same charge repel or shoot away from each other so for a long time it was a mystery to scientists how the positively charged protons in the nucleus stayed together they solved this by finding a particle called a gluon its name comes from the word glue as gluons act like atomic glue sticking the protons together using the strong nuclear force it is this force which also holds the quarks together that make up the protons and neutrons a diagram showing the main difficulty in nuclear fusion the fact that protons which have positive charges repel each other when forced together the number of neutrons in relation to protons defines whether the nucleus is stable or goes through radioactive decay when there are too many neutrons or protons the atom tries to make the numbers the same by getting rid of the extra particles it does this by emitting radiation in the form of alpha beta or gamma decay nuclei can change through other means too nuclear fission is when the nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei releasing a lot of stored energy this release of energy is what makes nuclear fission useful for making bombs and electricity in the form of nuclear power the other way nuclei can change is through nuclear fusion when two nuclei join together or fuse to make a heavier nucleus this process requires extreme amounts of energy in order to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the protons as they have the same charge such high energies are most common in stars like our sun which fuses hydrogen for fuel electrons electrons orbit or travel around the nucleus they are called the atom s electron cloud they are attracted towards the nucleus because of the electromagnetic force electrons have a negative charge and the nucleus always has a positive charge so they attract each other around the nucleus some electrons are further out than others in different layers these are called electron shells in most atoms the first shell has two electrons and all after that have eight exceptions are rare but they do happen and are difficult to predict the further away the electron is from the nucleus the weaker the pull of the nucleus on it this is why bigger atoms with more electrons react more easily with other atoms the electromagnetism of the nucleus is not strong enough to hold onto their electrons and atoms lose electrons to the strong attraction of smaller atoms radioactive decay some elements and many isotopes have what is called an unstable nucleus this means the nucleus is either too big to hold itself together or has too many protons or neutrons when this happens the nucleus has to get rid of the excess mass or particles it does this through radiation an atom that does this can be called radioactive unstable atoms continue to be radioactive until they lose enough mass particles that they become stable all atoms above atomic number protons lead are radioactive there are three main types of radioactive decay alpha beta and gamma alpha decay is when the atom shoots out a particle having two protons and two neutrons this is essentially a helium nucleus the result is an element with atomic number two less than before so for example if a beryllium atom atomic number went through alpha decay it would become helium atomic number alpha decay happens when an atom is too big and needs to get rid of some mass beta decay is when a neutron turns into a proton or a proton turns into a neutron in the first case the atom shoots out an electron in the second case it is a positron like an electron but with a positive charge the end result is an element with one higher or one lower atomic number than before beta decay happens when an atom has either too many protons or too many neutrons gamma decay is when an atom shoots out a gamma ray or wave it happens when there is a change in the energy of the nucleus this is usually after a nucleus has already gone through alpha or beta decay there is no change in the mass or atomic number or the atom only in the stored energy inside the nucleus every radioactive element or isotope has what is named a half life this is how long it takes half of any sample of atoms of that type to decay until they become a different stable isotope or element large atoms or isotopes with a big difference between the number of protons and neutrons will therefore have a long half life because they must lose more neutrons to become stable marie curie discovered the first form of radiation she found the element and named it radium she was also the first female recipient of the nobel prize frederick soddy conducted an experiment to observe what happens as radium decays he placed a sample in a light bulb and waited for it to decay suddenly helium containing protons and neutrons appeared in the bulb and from this experiment he discovered this type of radiation has a positive charge james chadwick discovered the neutron by observing decay products of different types of radioactive isotopes chadwick noticed that the atomic number of the elements was lower than the total atomic mass of the atom he concluded that electrons could not be the cause of the extra mass because they barely have mass enrico fermi used the neutrons to shoot them at uranium he discovered that uranium decayed a lot faster than usual and produced a lot of alpha and beta particles he also believed that uranium got changed into a new element he named hesperium otto hanh and fritz strassmann repeated fermi s experiment to see if the new element hesperium was actually created they discovered two new things fermi did not observe by using a lot of neutrons the nucleus of the atom would split producing a lot of heat energy also the fission products of uranium were already discovered thorium palladium radium radon and lead fermi then noticed that the fission of one uranium atom shot off more neutrons which then split other atoms creating chain reactions he realised that this process is called nuclear fission and could create huge amounts of heat energy that very discovery of fermi s led to the development of the first nuclear bomb code named trinity references other websites general information on atomic structure atomic structure timeline atom science citizendium nebula

galaxies planets moons asteroids comets and nebulae phenomena outside the earth s atmosphere are also studied that includes supernovae explosions gamma ray bursts and cosmic microwave background radiation astronomy concerns the development physics chemistry meteorology and movement of celestial bodies as well as the structure and development of the universe astronomy is one of the oldest sciences ancient people used the positions of the stars to navigate and to find when was the best time to plant crops astronomy is very similar to astrophysics a related subject cosmology is concerned with studying the universe as a whole and the way the universe changed over time astronomy is not the same as astrology the belief that the patterns the stars and the planets may affect human lives since the th century there have been two main types of astronomy observational and theoretical astronomy observational astronomy uses telescopes and cameras to observe or look at stars galaxies and other astronomical objects theoretical astronomy uses maths and computer models to explain the observations and predict what might happen working together theories predict what should happen and observations show whether the predictions work the main work of astronomy is to explain puzzling features of the universe for thousands of years the most important issue was the motions of planets now many other topics are studied history of astronomy ancient early astronomers used only their eyes to look at the stars they made maps of the constellations and stars for religious reasons and calendars to work out the time of year early civilisations such as the maya people and the ancient egyptians built simple observatories and drew maps of the stars positions they also began to think about the place of earth in the universe for a long time people thought earth was the center of the universe and that the planets the stars and the sun went around it this is known as geocentrism ancient greeks tried to explain the motions of the sun and stars by taking measurements a mathematician named eratosthenes was the first who measured the size of the earth and proved that the earth is a sphere a theory by another mathematician named aristarchus was that the sun is in the center and the earth is moving around it this is known as heliocentrism only a few people thought it was right the rest continued to believe in the geocentric model most of the names of constellations and stars come from greeks of that time arabic astronomers made many advancements during the middle ages including improved star maps and ways to estimate the size of the earth they also learned from the ancients by translating greek books into arabic renaissance to modern era drawings of the moon by galileo his drawings were more detailed than anyone before him because he used a telescope to look at the moon during the renaissance a priest named nicolaus copernicus thought from looking at the way the planets moved that the earth was not the center of everything based on previous works he said that the earth was a planet and all the planets moved around the sun this brought back the old idea of heliocentrism a physicist called galileo galilei built his own telescopes and used them to look more closely at the stars and planets for the first time he agreed with copernicus the catholic church decided that galileo was wrong he had to spend the rest of his life under house arrest heliocentric ideas were soon improved by johannes kepler and isaac newton who invented the theory of gravity after galileo people made better telescopes and used them to see farther objects such as the planets uranus and neptune they also saw how stars were similar to our sun but in a range of colours and sizes they also saw thousands of other faraway objects such as galaxies and nebulae modern era the th century after saw important changes in astronomy in the early s it began to be accepted that the galaxy in which we live the milky way is not the only galaxy the existence of other galaxies was settled by edwin hubble who identified the andromeda nebula as a different galaxy it was also hubble who proved that the universe was expanding there were many other galaxies at large distances and they are receding moving away from our galaxy that was completely unexpected in karl jansky discovered radio emission from outside the earth when trying to isolate a source of noise in radio communications marking the birth of radio astronomy and the first attempts at using another part of the electromagnetic spectrum to observe the sky those parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that the atmosphere did not block were now opened up to astronomy allowing more discoveries to be made the opening of this new window on the universe saw the discovery of entirely new things for example pulsars which sent regular pulses of radio waves out into space the waves were first thought to be alien in origin because the pulses were so regular that it implied an artificial source the period after world war saw more observatories where large and accurate telescopes are built and operated at good observing sites normally by governments for example bernard lovell began radio astronomy at jodrell bank using leftover military radar equipment by the site had the largest steerable radio telescope in the world similarly the end of the s saw the start of the building of dedicated observatories at mauna kea in hawaii a good site for visible and infra red telescopes thanks to its high altitude and clear skies the next great revolution in astronomy was thanks to the birth of rocketry this allowed telescopes to be placed in space on satellites space telescopes gave access for the first time in history to the entire electromagnetic spectrum including rays that had been blocked by the atmosphere the x rays gamma rays ultraviolet light and parts of the infra red spectrum were all opened to astronomy as observing telescopes were launched as with other parts of the spectrum new discoveries were made from s satellites were launched to be replaced with more accurate and better satellites causing the sky to be mapped in nearly all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum discoveries discoveries broadly come in two types bodies and phenomena bodies are things in the universe whether it is a planet like our earth or a galaxy like our milky way phenomena are events and happenings in the universe bodies for convenience this section has been divided by where these astronomical bodies may be found those found around stars are solar bodies those inside galaxies are galactic bodies and everything else larger are cosmic bodies solar planets asteroids comets galactic stars diffuse objects nebulas clusters compact stars white dwarf stars neutron stars black holes cosmic galaxies galaxy clusters superclusters phenomena burst events are those where there is a sudden change in the heavens that disappears quickly these are called bursts because they are normally associated with large explosions producing a burst of energy they include supernovas novas periodic events are those that happen regularly in a repetitive way the name periodic comes from period which is the length of time required for a wave to complete one cycle periodic phenomena include pulsars variable stars noise phenomena tend to relate to things that happened a long time ago the signal from these events bounce around the universe until it seems to come from everywhere and varies little in intensity in this way it resembles noise the background signal that pervades every instrument used for astronomy the most common example of noise is static seen on analogue televisions the principal astronomical example is cosmic background radiation methods instruments telescopes are the main tool of observing they take all the light in a big area and put in into a small area this is like making your eyes very big and powerful astronomers use telescopes to look at things that are far away and dim telescopes make objects look bigger closer brighter spectrometers study the different wavelengths of light this shows what something is made of many telescopes are in satellites they are space observatories techniques there are way astronomers can get better pictures of the heavens light from a distant source reaches a sensor and gets measured normally by a human eye or a camera for very dim sources there may not be enough light particles coming from the source for it to be seen one technique that astronomers have for making it visible is using integration which is like longer exposures in photography integration astronomical sources do not move much only the rotation and movement of the earth causes them to move across the heavens as light particles reach the camera over time they hit the same place making it brighter and more visible than the background until it can be seen telescopes at most observatories and satellite instruments can normally track a source as it moves across the heavens making the star appear still to the telescope and allowing longer exposures also images can be taken on different nights so exposures span hours days or even months in the digital era digitised pictures of the sky can be added together by computer which overlays the images after correcting for movement aperture synthesis with radio telescopes smaller telescopes can be combined together to create a big one which works like one as big as the distance between the two smaller telescopes adaptive optics adaptive optics means changing the shape of the mirror or lens while looking at something to see it better data analysis data analysis is the process of getting more information out of an astronomical observation than by simply looking at it the observation is first stored as data this data will then have various techniques used to analyse it fourier analysis fourier analysis in mathematics can show if an observation over a length of time is changing periodically changes like a wave if so it can extract the frequencies and the type of wave pattern and find many things including new planets fields a good example of a fields comes from pulsars which pulse regularly in radio waves these turned out to be similar to some but not all of a type of bright source in x rays called a low mass x ray binary it turned out that all pulsars and some lmxbs are neutron stars and that the differences were due to the environment in which the neutron star was found those lmxbs that were not neutron stars turned out to be black holes this section attempts to provide an overview of the important fields of astronomy their period of importance and the terms used to describe them it should be noted that astronomy in the modern era has been divided mainly by electromagnetic spectrum although there is some evidence this is changing fields by body solar astronomy solar astronomy is the study of the sun the sun is the closest star to earth at around million miles away it is the easiest to observe in detail observing the sun can help us understand how other stars work and are formed changes in the sun can affect the weather and climate on earth a stream of charged particles called the solar wind is constantly sent off from the sun the solar wind hitting the earth s magnetic field causes the northern lights studying the sun helped people understand how nuclear fusion works planetary astronomy planetary astronomy is the study of planets moons dwarf planets comets and asteroids as well as other small objects that orbit stars the planets of our own solar system have been studied in depth by many visiting spacecraft such as cassini huygens saturn and the voyager and galactic astronomy galactic astronomy is the study of distant galaxies studying distant galaxies is the best way of learning about our own galaxy as the gases and stars in our own galaxy make it difficult to observe galactic astronomers attempt to understand the structure of galaxies and how they are formed through the use of different types of telescopes and computer simulations fields by electromagnetic spectrum radio astronomy radio telescope magnetohydrodynamics mhd hydrodynamics is used in astronomy for mathematically modelling how gases behave strong magnetic fields found around many bodies can drastically change how these gases behave affecting things from star formation to the flows of gases around compact stars this makes mhd an important and useful tool in astronomy other fields gravitational wave astronomy gravitational wave astronomy is the study of the universe in the gravitational wave spectrum so far all astronomy that has been done has used the electromagnetic spectrum gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime emitted by very dense objects changing shape which include white dwarves neutron stars and black holes because no one has been able to detect gravitational waves directly the impact of gravitational wave astronomy has been very limited related pages asteroid black hole comet list of comets galaxy meteor planet satellite natural word for

in greece uses columns all made in stone architecture is the art and science of the design of structures or buildings such as houses places of worship and office buildings architecture is also the profession of an architect usually a person must study at an institution of higher education university to become an architect in ancient times there were architects long before there was higher education architecture can be about small designs such as a garage or large designs such as a whole city architecture often overlaps with civil engineering and architects and civil engineers often work together history romanesque groin vault in the past people built huts and wood houses to protect themselves from the weather for safety they were often close together great civilizations like the ancient egyptians built large temples and structures like the great pyramids of giza the ancient greeks and romans made what we now call classical architecture the romans working over years ago copied the arch from the etruscans who copied it from the mesopotamians the stone columns which still hold up so many important buildings like the parthenon in athens were simply copied from the first wooden posts a simpler building in hungary classical architecture was very formal and it always obeyed laws it used symmetry which really means balance and it used proportion which means keeping shapes in certain ways the golden mean was a rule or law which said to put it very simply if you are making a room or any other thing it will work best if you always make the long side times as long as the short side there are many laws in classical architecture like how high the middle of an arched bridge needs to be which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be these laws were learned from thousands of years of experience and they are as true today as they were years ago in some parts of the world like india the architecture is famous for carving the stone on temples and palaces different architectural styles were made in china japan southeast asia africa mexico and central and south america later people in western europe in the middle ages made romanesque architecture then gothic architecture gothic buildings have tall pointed windows and arches many churches have gothic architecture castles were also built at this time in eastern europe churches usually had domes people added their own ideas and decoration to the classical architecture of the past the renaissance brought a return to classical ideas architecture can have many styles such as the curved guggenheim museum in new york city in the late th century with the industrial revolution people began to invent machines to make things quickly and cheaply many factories and mills were built during or after this revolution decades later in the victorian era architects like george fowler jones and decimus burton still followed the gothic style to build new churches up to this point buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and masonry used to construct them gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with buttresses allowed stone buildings to be built taller for example the cathedral in ulm germany is over feet tall however building with stone has its limits and building too tall could result in collapse this happened to the beauvais cathedral which was never completed new technology allows new kinds of buildings such as for the willis tower in chicago towards the end of the th century with a second industrial revolution steel became much cheaper architects began to use inventions like metal girders and reinforced concrete to build an example is the eiffel tower in paris buildings can now be built taller than ever before we call them skyscrapers this new technology has made us free from traditional limitations and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated replaced or abandoned cheap strong glass soon brought transparent exterior walls especially for office buildings modernism is the name for the architectural style which developed because of these new building technologies and its beginnings can been seen as early as modernism can also refer to a specific group of architects and buildings from the early to late th century and so may not be the proper term to use for many building built since then which are sometimes called post modern many of the world s greatest structures were built by modern day architects such as frank lloyd wright i m pei adrian smith edward durell stone frank gehry fazlur khan gottfried bhm and bruce graham related pages architect art

anatomy is the study of the bodies of people and other animals anatomy is the study of the inside of the body and outside the body anatomy notes the position and structure of organs such as muscles glands and bones a person who studies anatomy is an anatomist the history of anatomy dates back to bc when egyptians began studying human anatomy they discovered the functions of many organs like the liver spleen kidneys heart etc and were the first to discover the structure and functions of the lymphatic system for long periods the dissection of deceased people was forbidden and correct ideas about human anatomy was a long time coming academic human anatomists are usually employed by universities medical schools and teaching hospitals they are often involved in teaching and research gross anatomy studies parts of the body that are big enough to see micro anatomy studies smaller parts body systems there are different organ systems such as the cardiovascular system also known as the circulatory system the system that gets blood around the body the muscular system the system that contains muscles the nervous system the system that controls the nerves and the brain and the skeleton

photo of asteroid mathilde taken by near an asteroid is a space rock it is a small object in the solar system that travels around the sun it is like a planet but smaller they range from very small smaller than a car to miles km across a few asteroids have asteroid moon the name asteroid means like a star in the ancient greek language asteroids may look like small stars in the sky but they really do move around the sun while stars only seem to move because the earth spins like planets asteroids do not make their own light because of this some people think asteroids is not a good name and think that the name planetoid like a planet would be a better name giuseppe piazzi found the first asteroid in he called it ceres and it is the biggest object in the asteroid belt others like juno pallas and vesta were found later in the s so many had been found that they were numbered by a minor planet designation starting with ceres today astronomers using computerized telescopes find thousands of asteroids every month asteroid impact prediction is one of the purposes asteroids are the leftover rock and other material from the formation of the solar system these rocks were too small to come together to make a planet some are made of carbon or metal depending on what s on the surface they are classified into various asteroid spectral types including type m metal type s stone and type c carbon most asteroids in our solar system are in the asteroid belt between mars and jupiter many are not in the main asteroid belt the ones that come close to earth are called near earth asteroids many scientists think asteroids striking the earth killed off all the dinosaurs and caused some of the other extinction events afghanistn officially called islamic republic of afghanistan is a country located in central asia and south asia it has borders with pakistan in the south and east iran in the west turkmenistan uzbekistan and tajikistan in the north and china in the far northeast in early times people passed through it with animals and other goods as it connected china and india with central asia and the middle east more recently afghanistan has been damaged by many years of war and there not being enough jobs the country is around square miles square kilometers in size or area there are million people in afghanistan there are about million afghan refugees people who had to leave the country who are in pakistan and iran for some time kabul its capital had about people living in it in geography snow capped koh i baba mountains in bamyan province of afghanistan afghanistan has many mountains the mountains are called the hindu kush and himalayas the big mountain in afghanistan is mount nowshak there are plains which have soil that is good for growing plants and foothills part is also dry and called the registan desert afghanistan has snow and glaciers in the mountains amu darya is the big water stream or river the country has a lot of a valuable stone called lapis lazuli which was used to decorate the tomb of the egyptian king tutankhamun climate afghanistan has a continental climate with hot summers and cold winters having no water sometimes causes problems for farmers sandstorms happen a lot in the desert plants and animals endangered snow leopards live in the cold hindu kush but they have thick fur to stay warm hunters sell the soft leopard skins in the markets in the capital kabul southern afghanistan has not many plants because it is dry there are more plants where there is more water mountains have forests of pine and fir cedar oak walnut alder and ash trees afghanistan s animals are in the mountains there are wolves foxes jackals bears and wild goats gazelles wild dogs camels and wild cats such as the snow leopard in the country the birds are falcons eagles and vultures the rhesus macaque and the red flying squirrel are also in afghanistan many years of war hunting and years of no water have killed animals in afghanistan there used to be tigers in afghanistan but now there aren t any bears and wolves are almost gone people and culture the afghan youth voices festival at the gardens of babur in kabul many different cultures have moved through or invaded the land of afghanistan today the people of afghanistan known as afghans have many traits passed down from these groups the largest ethnic group group of people considered the same in some or multiple ways is the pashtuns who make up about half the afghan people tajiks are the second largest ethnic group making up about one fifth of the population before the th century tajiks were called sarts and some come from the iranian peoples most pashtuns are also related to the iranian peoples and some pashtuns and tajiks marry each other but at the same time they are rivals the third largest ethnic group are the hazaras they are native to the hazaristan area in central afghanistan the country s other ethnic groups include the uzbek aimaq turkmen nuristani baloch pashayi and a few others dari persian and pashto are the official languages of afghanistan bilingualism is very common both are indo european languages from the iranian languages sub family they are usually written with the arabic alphabet uzbek and turkmen are widely spoken in the north and nuristani and pashai are spoken in the east almost all afghans follow the religion of islam afghanistan is a largely rural country which means that there are only few major cities and much spaced apart land only about one fifth of the population lives in cities kabul the capital is the largest city it is along the kabul river south of the hindu kush range other cities in afghanistan include kandahar herat mazar e sharif and jalalabad the rural population is made up of farmers and nomads people who move or travel from place to place the farmers live mainly in small villages along the rivers the nomads live in tents while moving from place to place with their animals and belongings some afghan people live in the high central mountains or the deserts in the south and southwest millions of people escaped from afghanistan in order to not get involved in the wars that happened in the late th and early st centuries most of them lived in neighboring pakistan and iran history afghanistan is in the path of important trade routes that connect southern and eastern asia to europe and the middle east because of this many empire builders have decided to rule over the area signs that these emperors were near afghanistan still exist in many parts of the country afghanistan is near what used to be the silk road so it has many cultures from up to years ago the peoples of afghanistan helped develop create major world religions traded and exchanged many products and sometimes controlled politics and culture in asia prehistory zoroaster the founder of zoroastrianism lived in bactria an ancient land in the north of today s afghanistan archaeologists digging a cave in what is now northeastern afghanistan in badakhshan discovered that people lived in the country as early as years ago they found the skull of a neanderthal or early human as well as tools from about years ago in other parts of afghanistan archaeologists uncovered pottery and tools that are to years old evidence that afghans were among the first people in the world to grow crops and raise animals a stone female figurine known as bactrian princess from bactria north of afghanistan about years ago farmers and herders settled in the plains surrounding the hindu kush as early as b c these people may have grown rich off the lapis lazuli they found along riverbeds which they traded to early city sites to the west across the iranian plateau and mesopotamia as farms and villages grew and thrived in afghanistan these ancient people eventually invented irrigation digging ditches for water so it flows to crops that allowed them to grow crops on the northern afghanistan desert plains this civilization advanced state of organization is today called bmac bactria margiana archaeological complex or the oxus civilization the oxus civilization expanded as far east as western edge of the indus valley during the period between and b c these people who were the ancestors of the indo aryans used the term aryan to identify their ethnicity culture and religion scholars know this when they read the ancient texts of these people the avesta of iranian people and the vedas of indo aryans zoroaster the founder of the zoroastrian religion the world s earliest monotheistic religion meaning a religion believing in one god lived in the area somewhere north of today s afghanistan around b c ancient history names of territories during the caliphate in ce khorasan was part of persia in yellowish by the middle of the sixth century bc the achaemenids took over control of the land which was previously held by the medes and made it part of the persian empire alexander the great defeated and conquered the persian empire in bc he founded some cities in the area and greek culture and language continued to influence the people for a long period right up to the islamic conquest in the th century a d after alexander greco bactrians scythians kushans parthians and sassanians ruled the area kushans spread buddhism from india in the st century b c and buddhism remained an important religion in the area until the th century the buddhas of bamiyan were the remainder of buddhism in afghanistan those giant statues were destroyed by the very religious taliban in despite international protests in defence of the priceless art the taliban believed that those ancient statues were un islamic and a curse on afghanistan medieval history arabs introduced islam in the th century and slowly began spreading the new religion in the th and th centuries many local islamic dynasties rose to power inside afghanistan one of the earliest was the tahirids whose kingdom included balkh and herat they established independence from the abbasids in the tahirids were succeeded in about by the saffarids of zaranj in western afghanistan local princes in the north soon became feudatories of the powerful samanids who ruled from bukhara from to north of the hindu kush in afghanistan enjoyed a golden age under samanid rule in the th century the local ghaznavids turned ghazni into their capital and firmly established islam throughout all areas of afghanistan except the kafiristan region in the northeast mahmud of ghazni a great ghaznavid sultan conquered the multan and punjab region and carried raids into the heart of india mohammed bin abdul jabbar utbi al utbi a historian from the th century wrote that thousands of afghans were in the ghaznavid army the ghaznavid dynasty was replaced by the ghorids of ghor in the late th century who reconquered ghaznavid territory in the name of islam and ruled it until the ghorid army also included ethnic afghans ahmad shah durrani founder of the modern state of afghanistan in afghanistan was recognized as khorasan meaning land of the rising sun which was a prosperous and independent geographic region reaching as far as the indus river all the major cities of modern afghanistan were centers of science and culture in the past the new persian literature arose and flourished in the area the early persian poets such as rudaki were from what is now afghanistan moreover ferdowsi the author of shahnameh the national epic of iran and rumi the famous sufi poet were also from modern day afghanistan it has produced scientists such as avicenna al farabi al biruni omar khayym al khwarizmi and many others who are widely known for their important contributions in areas such as mathematics astronomy medicine physics geography and geology it remained the cultural capital of persia until the devastating mongol invasion in the th century timur the turkic conqueror took over in the end of the th century and began to rebuild cities in this region timur s successors the timurids were great patrons of learning and the arts who enriched their capital city of herat with fine buildings under their rule afghanistan enjoyed peace and prosperity between south of the hindu kush and the indus river today s pakistan was the native land of the afghan tribes they called this land afghanistan meaning land of the afghans the afghans ruled the rich northern indian subcontinent with their capital at delhi from the th to the early th century afghanistan was disputed between the safavids of isfahan and the mughals of agra who had replaced the lodi and suri afghan rulers in india the safavids and mughals occasionally oppressed the native afghans but at the same time the afghans used each empire to punish the other in the hotaki afghans rose to power and completely defeated the persian empire then they marched towards the mughals of india and nominally defeated them with the help of the afsharid forces under nader shah afshar in after nader shah of persia was killed a great leader named ahmad shah durrani united all the different muslim tribes and established the afghan empire durrani empire he is considered the founding father of the modern state of afghanistan while mirwais hotak is the grandfather of the nation recent history during the s afghanistan became a buffer zone between two powerful empires british india and russia as british india advanced into afghanistan russia felt threatened and expanded southward across central asia to stop the russian advance britain tried to make afghanistan part of its empire but the afghans fought wars with british led indians from to and from to after the third war in afghanistan under king amanullah gained respect and recognition as a completely independent state the kingdom of afghanistan was a constitutional monarchy established in it was the successor state to the emirate of afghanistan on september during the reign of zahir shah the kingdom of afghanistan joined the league of nations during world war ii afghanistan remained neutral it pursued a diplomatic policy of non alignment the creation of pakistan in as its eastern neighbor created problems in political crises led to the overthrow of the king the country s new leader ended the monarchy and made afghanistan a republic in a communist political party supported by the soviet union seized control of afghanistan s government this move sparked rebellions throughout the country the government asked the soviet union for military assistance the soviets took advantage of the situation and invaded afghanistan in december most people in afghanistan opposed the sudden soviet presence in their country for nearly a decade anti communist islamic forces known as mujahideen were trained inside neighboring pakistan to fight the soviets and the afghan government the united states and other anti soviet countries supported the mujahideen in the long war over one million afghan civilians were killed the soviet army also lost more than soldiers in that war millions of afghans left their country to stay safe in neighboring pakistan and iran in the soviet army withdrew the last of its troops afghan president hamid karzai at the afghan independence day in kabul after the soviets left different afghan warlords began fighting for control of the country the warlords received support from other countries including neighboring pakistan and iran a very conservative islamic group known as the taliban emerged in an attempt to end the civil war by the late s the taliban had gained control over of afghanistan a group known as the northern alliance based in northern afghanistan near the border with tajikistan continued to fight against the taliban nato trained afghan national army ana nato s military terminal at kabul international airport the taliban ruled afghanistan according to their strict version of islamic law people whom the taliban believed violated these laws were given cruel punishments in addition the taliban completely restricted the rights of women because of such policies most countries refused to recognize the taliban government only pakistan saudi arabia and the united arab emirates uae accepted them as the official government the taliban also angered other countries by allowing suspected terrorists to live freely in afghanistan among them were osama bin laden and members of the al qaeda terrorist network in september the united states blamed bin laden for the terrorist attacks on the world trade center in new york city and the pentagon outside washington d c the taliban refused to hand him over to the united states in response the united states and its allies launched a bombing campaign against al qaeda in october within months the taliban abandoned kabul and a new government led by hamid karzai came to power but fighting between the taliban and us led armies continued taliban fighters have gone into afghanistan from neighboring pakistan afghans accuse pakistan s military of being behind the taliban militants but pakistan has rejected this and stated that a stable afghanistan is in pakistan s own interest in december hamid karzai became the first democratically elected president of afghanistan nato began rebuilding afghanistan including its military and government institutions many schools and colleges were built freedom for women has improved women can study work drive and run for office many afghan women work as politicians some are ministers while at least one is a mayor others have opened businesses or joined the military or police afghanistan s economy has also improved dramatically and nato agreed in to help the country for at least another years after in the meantime afghanistan improved diplomatic ties with many countries in the world and continues government afghanistan is a newly formed democracy under the new constitution the president and two vice presidents are elected every five years the international security force assistance isaf helps the government maintain peace and rebuild the country the government still faces problems with the taliban internal security and

the remains and objects left by the people who lived long ago these remains can include old coins tools buildings and inscriptions archaeologists the people who study archaeology use these remains to understand how people lived fieldwork a th century bc bronze age hoard from stockheim in germany when archaeologists do fieldwork they look for remains often by digging in the ground as settlements places where people lived in groups change and grow old buildings get buried usually this is a natural process a typical student project is to leave an object in a place where there is nothing going on it will get covered rather quickly because wind water and plants will bury it sometimes buildings are deliberately buried to make way for new buildings ancient rome for example is now up to feet metres below the present city this process of natural or man made burial is why archaeological fieldwork involves digging and is expensive and takes a long time when things are found or even when nothing is found the results of the fieldwork are taken back to a base short term the base is often on or near the site longer term the results will usually go to a university or museum everything is written down on paper or entered into a computer gradually they build up a picture of what happened long ago archaeologists publish their research so others can understand what they learned fields of interest archaeologists do not all study the same topics they have specialties some fields of interest include ancient egypt these specialists are called egyptologists ancient china or the vikings archaeologists study every civilization that is known especially the ones where there is no written history they can study any time period for example one might study the beginning of human life in africa or study world war ii marine archaeologists study things that are now underwater they search for sunken ships or cities that have been lost under the sea subdisciplines there are many different ways of doing archaeology these depend on the methods used the things studied and the environment some of these subdisciplines overlap with each other marine archaeology archaeology relating to oceans seas and lakes is usually done underwater it includes the study of sunken ships and submerged coastlines maritime archaeology is a part of this subdivision it refers to the archaeological investigation of past ships and seafaring a famous example of maritime archaeology is the recovery and restoration of the ship burial at sutton hoo ice patch archaeology when a glacier melts objects that were captured in it are revealed the recovery and study of these objects is called ice patch archaeology a famous example is tzi the iceman historical archaeology historical archaeology deals with places things and issues from the past or present at or related to sites with written records or oral traditions or it can be defined as the archaeological investigation of any past culture that has developed a literate tradition a prominent example of historical archaeology is the work done at colonial williamsburg industrial archaeology this relatively new branch of archaeology consists of the systematic study of structures and artefacts as a means of enlarging our understanding of the industrial past archaeozoology archaeozoology or zooarchaeology is the study of the relationships between humans and animals in the archaeological record this includes the study of bones feathers teeth and other body parts as well as their interpretation experimental archaeology this field involves attempts at replicating the actions and conditions of ancient cultures good examples are butser ancient farm and overton down sites in many countries governments and other groups of people protect important archaeological sites so they will not be destroyed and so that visitors can always come and see them sometimes archaeological sites are found when foundations are dug for new buildings archaeologists have to work quickly when this happens because people who are building often don t have a lot of time as soon as the archaeologists are done with their work the remains that they have found will be covered over unless they are very important related pages civilization references other websites archaeology citizendium the word application has several uses in medicine application means putting some drug or ointment usually on the skin where it is absorbed into the human body in computer software an application is a type of program which is designed for a particular function example word processing in business or government an application is a usually paper form filled out and handed in by a person seeking a privilege from a state or company such as work credit

get energy from other living things they usually eat other living things but some are parasites or have photosynthetic protists as symbionts plants are also multicellular eukaryotic organisms but most animals are mobile meaning they can move around animals take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide this cellular respiration is part of their metabolism chemical working in both these ways they are different from plants also the cells of animals have different cell membranes to other eukaryotes like plants and fungi grouping animals there are many different types of animals the common animals most people know are only about of the animal kingdom when biologists look at animals they find things that certain animals have in common they use this to group the animals in a biological classification they think several million species exist but they have only identified about one million animals can mainly be divided into two main groups the invertebrates and the vertebrates vertebrates have a backbone or spine invertebrates do not vertebrates are fish or fishes both ways are correct amphibians reptiles birds mammals some invertebrates are insects spiders crustaceans molluscs like a snail or squid worms jellyfish in scientific usage humans are considered animals in everyday nonscientific usage humans are often not considered to be animals life styles the animal mode of nutrition is called heterotrophic because they get their food from other living organisms some animals eat only plants they are called herbivores other animals eat only meat and are called carnivores animals that eat both plants and meat are called omnivores the environments animals live in vary greatly by the process of evolution animals adapt to the habitats they live in a fish is adapted to its life in water and a spider is adapted to a life catching and eating insects a mammal living on the savannahs of east africa lives quite a different life from a dolphin or porpoise catching fish in the sea the fossil record of animals goes back about million years to the ediacaran period or somewhat earlier during the whole of this long time animals have been constantly evolving so that the animals alive on earth today are very different from those on the edges of the sea floor in the ediacaran the study of ancient life is called palaeontology related pages list of animal phyla references acceleration is a measure of how fast velocity changes acceleration is the change of velocity divided by the change of time acceleration is a vector and therefore includes both a size and a direction examples an object was moving north at meters per second the object speeds up and now is moving north at meters per second the object has accelerated an apple is falling down it starts falling at meters per second at the end of the first second the apple is moving at meters per second the apple has accelerated at the end of the second second the apple is moving down at meters per second the apple has accelerated again jane is walking east at kilometers per hour jane s velocity does not change jane s acceleration is zero tom was walking east at kilometers per hour tom turns and walks south at kilometers per hour tom has had a nonzero acceleration sally was walking east at kilometers per hour sally slows down after sally walks east at kilometers per hour sally has had a nonzero acceleration acceleration due to gravity finding acceleration acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of an object acceleration can be found by using where is the velocity at the start is the velocity at the end is the time at the start is the time at the end sometimes the change in velocity is written as sometimes the change in time is written as t in difficult situations the acceleration can be calculated using mathematics in calculus acceleration is the derivative of the velocity with respect to time units of measurement acceleration has its own units of measurement for example if velocity is measured in meters per second and if time is measured in seconds then acceleration is measured in meters per second squared m s other words acceleration can be positive or negative when the acceleration is negative but the velocity does not change direction it is sometimes called deceleration for example when a car brakes it decelerates physicists usually only use the word acceleration newton s second law of motion newton s laws of motion are rules for how things move these rules are called laws of motion isaac newton is the scientist who first wrote down the main laws of motion according to newton s second law of motion the force something needs to accelerate an object depends on the object s mass the amount of stuff the object is made from or how heavy it is the formula of newton s second law of motion is where is the acceleration is the force and the mass this formula is very well known and it is very important in physics newton s second law of motion in short newton s second law is often one of the first things that physics students learn deceleration deceleration is the opposite of acceleration this means that something slows down instead of speeding up for example when a car brakes it is decelerating or retardating black pudding is an english name for blood sausage it is food made by cooking down the blood of any mammal usually pigs or cattle with meat fat or filler until it is thick enough to congeal become firm or solid when cooled types of black pudding german blutwurst in great britain blood sausage is called black pudding the

word bootstrap is also closely related and means to use something simpler to get something more complex to make itself work better it comes from the english phrase pull yourself up by your own bootstraps before a computer can operate normally it must have operating system instructions that tell it how to perform basic functions a boot device loads the operating system into the memory of the computer devices that can boot a computer are usually boot disks or boot drives normally a hard drive but can be a floppy disk or a cd some network computers use boot chips that get the operating system over a network web phones also use such chips to identify the user to the mobile phone network boot card standards may let many users boot kiosk computers with full privacy and access to all application software they own there are also boot boards or boot add in cards that are more permanent than boot cards some people refer to the boot device as just a boot and non boot devices as data devices although it is not the computer but the operating system that cares about the difference between these origin the boot in boot device is the same as booting or starting up this is short for bootstrapping or to start with simple stuff and make complex stuff out of it related pages booting category software right a boot is a type of footwear that protects the foot and ankle boots are

debts legally they are insolvent where it is a person who cannot pay their debts the person s creditors may ask the court to appoint a trustee in bankruptcy this is a professional accountant who is appointed by the court to take control of the bankrupt person s assets some assets are protected by law but the trustee in bankruptcy will sell off all of the other assets and use the money to pay as much of that person s debts as possible after the process is complete the person is discharged from bankruptcy and the person is free from any further liability to pay those claims but normally that person will be limited in their ability to borrow money again because their credit rating will be damaged where it is an organisation which cannot pay its debts the creditors may ask the court to appoint a liquidator the liquidator does a very similar job to the trustee in bankruptcy except that there are no assets which are tprotected so the liquidator can sell everything once all of the assets of the organisation have been sold the organisation is then dissolved and no longer exists organisations do not get discharged from bankruptcy in the same way that a living person does insolvency or bankrupcy people often confuse the terms bankruptcy and insolvency and sometimes they use one word when they really mean the other insolvency usually just means that a someone does not have enough money to pay their debts or sometimes that the total amount of their debts is worth more than the total amount of their assets bankruptcy is a formal legal process in front of the courts although the two terms are connected just because a person is insolvent does not necessarily mean that they will go into bankruptcy alternatives to bankruptcy many countries have alternatives to bankruptcy to try and allow people and businesses to try and avoid the bankruptcy process in various countries individual people can try and reach individual voluntary arrangements or ivas with their creditors this means that the creditors agree to take less money to discharge their debts there are similar processes for companies and other organisations and they go by various different names in different countries but in many countries they are called schemes of arrangement bankruptcy protection in many countries a company or business can ask the courts for bankruptcy protection to try and protect the business so that the creditors cannot destroy all of the physical capital and goodwill by breaking it apart and moving it away the aim of this is provide is more time for the business to reorganise itself and to work out a new deal between the owners and the people the business owes money in many countries this is called going into administration however not all countries have bankruptcy protection laws for businesses debt slavery often a creditor threatens a debtor with debt slavery in many parts of the world in some cases the debtor does not know that they have a right to go bankrupt this is a human rights problem in some countries also some creditors continue to harass a debtor even though bankruptcy laws say they should not hoping that the debtor will pay them money that they do not deserve united states bankruptcy in the united states falls mostly under federal law title of the united states code bankruptcy code the types of bankruptcy available in the united states are named after the primary divisions or chapters of that law the person or business that files a bankruptcy case is known as the debtor when a bankruptcy case is filed a trustee is chosen by the court the trustee has authority over the property of the bankrupt person or business and may use some of the debtor s assets to pay the creditors after a bankruptcy is filed creditors are notified that they are to stop trying to collect money directly from the debtor and are to make claims for payment to the bankruptcy court chapter the most common form of bankruptcy is the chapter bankruptcy which can be filed by businesses or individuals it is also called liquidation bankruptcy because some of a debtor s property may be sold liquidated to satisfy creditors when a business is in debt which it cannot pay it may ask or be forced to file bankruptcy in court under chapter this usually makes a company stop doing business employees often lose their jobs when company files for chapter chapter chapter bankruptcy is a complicated type of bankruptcy that reorganizes the debtor s finances usually reducing the amount of debt owed and changing debt repayment terms a chapter bankruptcy case allows a business to keep running while it finds ways to reduce and arrange payment of its debts almost all chapter bankruptcies are filed by businesses ordinary people do not usually file chapter bankruptcy because a chapter bankruptcy will almost always be cheaper and easier for them chapter chapter is the most popular form of bankruptcy in the united states for ordinary people in a chapter bankruptcy some of your debts may be forgiven discharged but you will have to pay back a portion of your debt the debt repayment plan is supervised by the bankruptcy court and usually lasts for three to five years businesses cannot file for chapter bankruptcy other bankruptcy chapters less common forms of bankruptcy may be filed under chapter and chapter of the bankruptcy code chapter bankruptcy allows municipalities smaller units of government such as cities and towns to restructure their debts chapter bankruptcy is a special type of bankruptcy for family farms and fishermen it combines elements of chapter and chapter bankruptcy to allow smaller farms and fishing businesses to stay open while they restructure their debts references breakfast sausage is a type of fresh pork sausage made from seasoned ground meat mixed with bread crumbs breakfast sausage has a blander flavor than many other types of sausage such as polish or italian style sausages using breakfast sausages breakfast sausages are not cured or smoked like other types of sausages which means that they have to be cooked soon after they are purchased unless they are frozen uncooked sausages should be stored in the refrigerator or the freezer individuals handling them should wash their hands in hot soapy water because uncooked pork is unhealthy for humans pork sausages have to be heated until all of the meat inside is cooked they are usually fried or grilled in a pan until they are browned and served at breakfast often with cooked eggs pancakes and toasted bread breakfast sausages are also used in

clockwise from right grapes persimmon red gooseberries red currants top several types of common berries none is a berry by botanical definition the blueberry is a false berry blackberries are aggregate fruit and strawberries are accessory fruit the word berry is used for many different kinds of small fruits that have many seeds and can be used as food some examples are raspberry strawberry lingonberry and blueberry when botanists talk about berries they mean a simple fruit produced from a single ovary they sometimes call this true berry to distinguish it from false berries by that statement of how words are used grapes or tomatoes are true berries the berry is the most common type of soft fruit in which the entire ovary wall gets to the right stage of development of the pericarp which can be taken as food the flowers of these plants have an upper ovary with one or more carpels the seeds are inside the soft body of the ovary berries are small sweet bright colored fruits due to this they are able to bring more animals towards them and spread their seeds some fruits that are called berries in english are not true berries by the use of words above these include raspberries strawberry blackberries cranberries and boysenberries some true berries do not have berry in their name these include tomatoes bananas eggplants guavas pomegranates and chillies pumpkins cucumbers melons oranges and lemons are also berries that have slightly different structure and may be called by different names pepo for pumpkins cucumbers and melons or hesperidium for oranges and lemons some kinds of beards a beard is the hair growing on the lower part of a man s face the hair that grows on the upper lip of some men is a mustache when a man has hair only below the lower lip and above the chin it is called a soul patch some men have a lot of hair and a big beard and some have very little in the modern world many men shave part or all of their beards or cut their beard so it does not get very long women can also have beards but it is less common some animals also have hair like this and people sometimes also call this hair a beard black in science in science an object that is black absorbs the light that hits it because these objects do not reflect any light the human eye can t see any color coming from that object the brain then sees these objects as black a way to create black objects is to mix pigments a pigment works by reflecting only the color of the pigment for example a blue pigment absorbs all colors except blue by mixing pigments in the right quantities black can be made because black objects absorb light they become warmer faster meaning of black black is associated with power elegance formality anarchy birth male and mystery black is a dark color the darkest color there is black along with gray and white is a neutral color this means that it is not a hot color or a cool color black is a color seen with fear and the unknown black holes it can have a bad meaning blacklist black birth black bat or a good meaning in the black black is beautiful black can stand for strength and power it can be a formal elegant and high class color black tie black mercedes black man black clothing is common in emo and goth subculture related pages list of colors blackbody radiation bubonic plague is the best known form of the disease plague which is caused by the bacterium yersinia pestis the name bubonic plague is specific for this form of the disease which enters through the skin and travels through the lymphatic system if the disease is left untreated it kills about half its victims in between three and seven days the bubonic plague was the disease that caused the black death which killed tens of millions of people in europe in the middle ages symptoms of this disease include coughing fever and black spots on the skin different kinds of the same disease there are different kinds of bubonic plague the most common form of the disease is spread by a certain kind of flea that lives on rats then there is an incubation period which can last from a few hours to about seven days septicemic plague sepsis happens when the bacterium enters the blood and makes it form tiny clots pneumonic plague this happens when the bacterium can enter the lungs about of all people with this form will die incubation period is only one to two days the abortive form this is the most harmless form it will result in a little fever after that there are antibodies that protect against all forms for a long time history the first recorded epidemic was in the eastern roman empire byzantine empire it was called the plague of justinian after emperor justinian i who was infected but survived through extensive treatment the pandemic resulted in the deaths of an estimated million th century outbreak to million people two centuries of recurrence during the s this epidemic struck parts of asia north africa and europe almost a third of the people in europe died of it unlike catastrophes that pull communities together this epidemic was so terrifying that it broke people s trust in one another giovanni boccaccio an italian writer of the time described it this scourge had implanted so great a terror in the hearts of men and women that brothers abandoned brothers uncles their nephews sisters their brothers and in many cases wives deserted their husbands but even worse fathers and mothers refused to nurse and assist their own children distribution of plague infected animals local outbreaks of the plague are grouped into three plague pandemics whereby the respective start and end dates and the assignment of some outbreaks to either pandemic are still subject to discussion the pandemics were the first plague pandemic from to spreading from egypt to the mediterranean starting with the plague of justinian and northwestern europe the second plague pandemic from to spreading from central asia to the mediterranean and europe starting with the black death and probably also to china the third plague pandemic from to spreading from china to various places around the world notably india and the west coast of the united states globally about cases of plague are reported a year in the countries with the most cases include the democratic republic of the congo madagascar and peru vector the transmission of y pestis by fleas is well known fleas are the vector the flea gets the bacteria as they feed on an infected animal usually a rodent several proteins then work to keep the bacteria in the flea digestive tract this is important for the survival of y pestis in fleas modern history in the th century some countries did research on the bacteria that causes bubonic plague they did research to use it for biological warfare samples of this bacteria are carefully controlled there is much paranoia fear about it dr thomas c butler a us expert in this organism was charged in october by the fbi with various crimes this happened after he said he lost samples of yersinia pestis this is the bacteria that causes bubonic plague the fbi did not find the samples they do not know what happened to them references

and the evolution of life living things include animals plants fungi such as mushrooms and microorganisms such as bacteria and archaea the term biology is relatively modern it was introduced in by a physician thomas beddoes people who study biology are called biologists biology looks at how animals and other living things called organisms behave and work and what they are like biology also studies how organisms react with each other and the environment it has existed as a science for about years and was preceded by natural history biology has many research fields and branches like all sciences biology uses the scientific method this means that biologists must be able to show evidence for their ideas and that other biologists must be able to test the ideas for themselves biology attempts to answer questions such as what are the characteristics of this living thing comparative anatomy how do the parts work physiology how should we group living things classification taxonomy what does this living thing do behavior growth how does inheritance work genetics what is the history of life paleontology how do living things relate to their environment ecology modern biology is

belgium has an area of around million people live in belgium it is a founding member of the european union and is home to its headquarters the capital city of belgium is brussels where the european union nato and other famous organisations are based there are three regions in belgium flanders is the name of the northern half of belgium just south of the netherlands most of the people in this region called the flemish people speak dutch wallonia is the name of the southern half of belgium just north of france here most of the people the walloons speak french there is a small part of wallonia next to the border with germany where the people speak german the brussels capital region where the capital of brussels is found is in the middle of the country but surrounded by flanders on all sides it used to be dutch speaking but today french is mostly spoken with some dutch the population is about dutch speaking french speaking and german speaking the so called deutschbelgier to look after all these groups belgium has a complicated system of government history the seventeen provinces orange brown and yellow areas and the bishopric of lige green philippe of belgium current king the name belgium comes from gallia belgica this was a roman province in the northernmost part of gaul before roman invasion in bc the belgae a mix of celtic and germanic peoples lived there the germanic frankish tribes during the th century brought the area under the rule of the merovingian kings a slow shift of power during the th century led the kingdom of the franks to change into the carolingian empire the treaty of verdun in divided the region into middle and west francia they were vassals either of the king of france or of the holy roman emperor many of these fiefdoms were united in the burgundian netherlands of the th and th centuries the eighty years war divided the low countries into the northern united provinces and the southern netherlands southern netherlands were ruled by the spanish and the austrian habsburgs this made up most of modern belgium after the campaigns of in the french revolutionary wars the low countries were added into the french first republic this ended austrian rule in the area adding back the low countries formed the united kingdom of the netherlands this happened at the end of the first french empire in the belgian revolution was in leopold i became king on this is now celebrated as belgium s national day episode of the belgian revolution of by egide charles gustave wappers museum of ancient art brussels the berlin conference of gave control of the congo free state to king leopold ii this was for him personally and not for the country of belgium starting in about many people did not like how he treated the congolese people in the belgian state took control of the colony it was then called the belgian congo germany invaded belgium in this was part of world war i the opening months of the war were very bad in belgium during the war belgium took over the of ruanda urundi modern day rwanda and burundi after the first world war the prussian districts of eupen and malmedy were added into belgium in the country was again invaded by germany in and under german control until after world war ii the people made king leopold iii leave his throne in this is because they thought he helped the germans in the belgian congo stopped being under belgian rule two years later ruanda urundi also became free belgium joined nato as a founding member government and politics since belgium is a federal state divided into three regions and three communities regions brussels capital region flemish region or flanders walloon region or wallonia communities flemish community french community of belgium german speaking community of belgium it has a system of government known as a constitutional monarchy meaning that it has a monarch but that the monarch does not rule the country and that a government is elected democratically belgium has had its own monarchy since king albert ii left the throne on july and the current king is philippe in belgium the government is elected between mid and late after no clear result in the election

once grew very well along the brazilian coast history the first people to come to brazil came around b c that group of people is often called the south american indians they probably came from north america some of them were hunters and gatherers but others were farmers flag of brazil pedro lvares cabral was the first european to see brazil he saw it in he was from portugal and the portuguese government claimed brazil soon explorers explored the whole coastline of brazil and colonies were set up in the late s and early s the dutch and the french would sometimes try to take land in brazil brazilians started moving inland farther than the treaty of tordesillas said they could this caused some fights with the spaniards and native people in the area in brazil claimed to be its own country and not a part of portugal anymore soon there was civil war but the emperor pedro ii improved the economy and in he freed the slaves in there was a military coup and pedro ii had to leave the country in brazil became a republic it was not very democratic because the only people who could vote were people who owned land there were some uprisings in the s because some people thought the government was unfairly helping coffee growers brazil joined the allies during world war ii during the s the leader castelo branco made the government like a dictatorship since then the country has become more democratic but some people feel that there are still big problems in health education crime poverty and social inequality in september then president dilma rousseff was removed from office because of

compounds and how these things work together and change history before people studied substances to figure out how to do things such as turn lead into gold but no one managed to do that this was called alchemy alchemists separated the air into many parts and isolated the noble gases from it they also processed special minerals from a mine in sweden to get rare earth metals radioactivity was also discovered today chemists have discovered different elements some are very common like oxygen many are very rare and expensive like platinum some cannot be found on earth and can only be made in labs like rutherfordium since the s the increased understanding of physics has changed chemists theories about chemical reactions with smaller and faster computers chemists have built better tools for analyzing substances these tools have been sent to study chemicals on mars police also use those tools to study evidence from crime scenes types of chemistry there are several types of chemistry analytical chemistry looks at which chemicals are in things for example looking at how much arsenic is in food organic chemistry looks at things that have carbon in them for example making acetylene inorganic chemistry looks at things that do not have carbon in them one example is making an integrated circuit a large area of chemistry is polymer chemistry this looks at plastics one example is making nylon because plastics are made of carbon polymer chemistry is part of organic chemistry another area is biochemistry this looks at the chemistry of living things an example would be seeing how arsenic poisons people biochemistry is also part of organic chemistry there are many other small branches of chemistry concepts of chemistry basic concepts the basic unit of an element is called an atom an atom is the smallest building block that you can cut an element into without the element breaking down turning into a lighter element for example through nuclear fission or radioactive decay a chemical compound is a substance made up of two or more elements in a compound two or more atoms are joined together to form a molecule the tiniest speck of dust or drop of liquid that one can see is made up of many millions or billions of these molecules mixtures are substances where chemicals are mixed but not reacted an example would be mixing sand and salt this can be undone again to produce salt and sand separately chemical compounds are changed by a chemical reaction an example would be heating sodium bicarbonate common baking soda it will make water carbon dioxide and sodium carbonate this reaction cannot be undone one very important concept in chemistry is that different atoms interact with one another in very specific proportions for example two hydrogen atoms interacting with one oxygen atom lead to the water molecule h o this relationship is known as the law of constant proportions and leads to the idea of stoichiometry a term that refers to the ratios of different atoms in chemical compounds for example in water there are always exactly hydrogen atoms to oxygen atom in carbon dioxide there are exactly oxygen atoms for carbon atom these relationships are described using chemical formulas such as h o two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom and co one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms mole because atoms of different elements react with one another in very specific proportions but atoms of different elements have different weights chemists often describe the amount of different elements and compounds in terms of the number of moles a mole of any element contains the same number of atoms atoms the atomic mass of an element can be used to see how much of the element makes a mole for example the atomic mass of copper is about that means about grams of copper metal has a mole of atoms the atomic mass of chlorine is about that means grams of chlorine has a mole of atoms in it moles can be used to see how many molecules are in chemical compounds too copper ii chloride is an example cucl is its chemical formula there is one copper atom and two chlorine atoms add all the molar masses of the elements together to get the molar mass of the chemical compound that means in grams of copper ii chloride there is one mole of copper ii chloride molecules this concept is used to calculate how much chemicals are needed in a chemical reaction if no reactants chemicals that are reacted should be left if too much reactant is used there will be some reactants left in the chemical reaction acids and bases acids and bases are common chemicals acids release h ions when in water and bases release oh ions when in water acids can react with bases the h ion is taken from the acid by the base this makes water h o a salt is also made when an acid and a base react together an example would be reacting hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh hydrochloric acid releases h and cl ions in water the base releases na and oh ions the h and the oh react to make water there is a solution of sodium chloride nacl left sodium chloride is a salt usefulness chemistry is very useful in everyday life and makes up the foundation of many branches of science most objects are made by chemists people who do chemistry chemists are constantly working to find new and useful substances chemists make new drugs and materials like paints that we use every day safety this chemist is wearing safety glasses a lab coat and gloves he is looking at a rock from the moon many chemicals are harmless but there are some chemicals that are dangerous for example mercury ii chloride is very toxic chromates can cause cancer tin ii chloride pollutes water easily hydrochloric acid can cause bad burns some chemicals like hydrogen can explode or catch fire to stay safe chemists experiment with chemicals in a chemical lab they use special equipment and clothing to do reactions and keep the chemicals contained the chemicals used in drugs and in things like bleach have been tested to make sure they are safe if used correctly related pages periodic table list of common elements common chemical apparatus laboratory techniques chemical techniques glycerol aerosol computer science is the study of manipulating managing transforming and encoding information there are many different areas in computer science some areas consider problems in an abstract manner while some need special machines called computers a person who works with computers will often need mathematics science and logic in order to design and work with computers common tasks for a computer scientist asking questions this is so that they can find new and easier ways to do things and the way to approach problems with this information asking the right question computers can do some things easily for example simple math or sorting out a list of names from a to z but computers cannot answer questions when there is not enough information or when there is no real answer also computers may take too much time to finish long tasks for example it may take too long to find the shortest way through all of the towns in the usa so instead a computer will try to make a close guess a computer will answer these simpler questions much faster answering the question algorithms are a specific set of instructions or steps on how to complete a task for example a computer scientist wants to sort playing cards there are many ways to sort them by suits diamonds clubs hearts and spades or by numbers jack queen king and ace by deciding on a set of steps to sort the cards the scientist has created an algorithm the scientist then needs to test whether this algorithm works this shows how well and how fast the algorithm sorts cards a simple but slow algorithm is drop the cards pick them up and check whether they are sorted if they are not do it again this method will work but it will take a very long time a better algorithm is find the first card with the smallest suit and smallest number of diamonds and place it at the start after this look for the second card and so on this algorithm is much faster and does not need much space this sorting algorithm is called selection sort ada lovelace wrote the first computer algorithm in for a computer that was never finished computers began during world war ii computer science separated from the other sciences during the s and s now computer science has its own methods and has its own technical terms it is related to electrical engineering mathematics and language science computer science looks at the theoretical parts of computers computer engineering looks at the physical parts of computers hardware software engineering looks at the use of computer programs and how to make them parts of computer science central math

computer jargon encyclopedia of computer terms references a drawing of a usual modern desktop computer a computer is a machine that accepts data as input procesess that data using programs and outputs the processed data many computers can store and retrieve information using hard drives computers can be connected together to form networks allowing connected computers to communicate with each other the two principal characteristics of a computer are it responds to a specific instruction set in a well defined manner and it can execute a prerecorded list of instructions a program there are four main processing steps in a computer inputting storage outputting and processing modern computers can do billions of calculations per second computers do many different jobs where automation is useful some examples are controlling traffic lights vehicle computers security systems washing machines and digital televisions computers can be designed to do almost anything with information computers are used to control large and small machines which in the past were controlled by humans most people have used a personal computer in their home or at work they are used for things such as listening to music reading the news and writing modern computers are electronic computer hardware they do mathematical arithmetic very quickly but computers do not really think they only follow the instructions in their software programs the software uses the hardware when the user gives it instructions and gives useful output humans control computers with user interfaces input devices include keyboards computer mice buttons and touch screens some computers can also be controlled with voice commands hand gestures or even brain signals through electrodes implanted in the brain or along nerves computer programs are designed or written by computer programmers a few programmers write programs in the computer s own language called machine code most programs are written using a programming language like c java and fortran these programming languages are more like the language with which one talks and writes every day the compiler translates the user s instructions into binary code machine code that the computer will understand and do what is needed history of computers the jacquard loom was one of the first programmable devices automation most humans have a problem with math to show this try doing in your head it is hard to remember all the steps people made tools to help them remember where they were in a math problem the other problem people have is that they have to do the same problem over and over and over again a cashier had to make change every day in her head or with a piece of paper that took a lot of time and made mistakes so people made calculators that did those same things over and over this part of computer history is called the history of automated calculation which is a fancy phrase for the history of machines that make it easy for me to do this same math problem over and over without making mistakes the abacus the slide rule the astrolabe and the antikythera mechanism which dates from about bc are examples of automated calculation machines programming people do not want a machine that would do the same thing over and over again for example a music box is a machine that plays the same music over and over again some people wanted to be able to tell their machine to do different things for example they wanted to tell the music box to play different music every time they wanted to be able to program the music box to order the music box to play different music this part of computer history is called the history of programmable machines which is a fancy phrase for the history of machines that i can order to do different things if i know how to speak their language one of the first examples of this was built by hero of alexandria c ad he built a mechanical theater which performed a play lasting minutes and was operated by a complex system of ropes and drums these ropes and drums were the language of the machine they told what the machine did and when some people argue that this is the first programmable machine historians disagree on which early machines are computers many say the castle clock an astronomical clock invented by al jazari in is the first known programmable analog computer the length of day and night could be adjusted every day in order to account for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year some count this daily adjustment as computer programming others say the first computer was made by charles babbage ada lovelace is considered to be the first programmer the computing era at the end of the middle ages people started thinking math and engineering were more important in wilhelm schickard made a mechanical calculator other europeans made more calculators after him they were not modern computers because they could only add subtract and multiply you could not change what they did to make them do something like play tetris because of this we say they were not programmable now engineers use computers to design and plan in joseph marie jacquard used punched paper cards to tell his textile loom what kind of pattern to weave he could use punch cards to tell the loom what to do and he could change the punch cards which means he could program the loom to weave the pattern he wanted this means the loom was programmable charles babbage wanted to make a similar machine that could calculate he called it the analytical engine because babbage did not have enough money and always changed his design when he had a better idea he never built his analytical engine as time went on computers were used more people get bored easily doing the same thing over and over imagine spending your life writing things down on index cards storing them and then having to go find them again the u s census bureau in had hundreds of people doing just that it was expensive and reports took a long time then an engineer worked out how to make machines do a lot of the work herman hollerith invented a tabulating machine that would automatically add up information that the census bureau collected the computing tabulating recording corporation which later became ibm made his machines they leased the machines instead of selling them makers of machines had long helped their users understand and repair them and ctr s tech support was especially good because of machines like this new ways of talking to these machines were invented and new types of machines were invented and eventually the computer as we know it was born analog and digital computers in the first half of the th century scientists started using computers mostly because scientists had a lot of math to figure out and wanted to spend more of their time thinking about science questions instead of spending hours adding numbers together for example if they had to launch a rocket ship they needed to do a lot of math to make sure the rocket worked right so they put together computers these analog computers used analog circuits which made them very hard to program in the s they invented digital computers and soon made them easier to program however this is not the case as many consecutive attempts have been made to bring arithmetic logic to l analogue computers are mechanical or electronic devices which solve problems some are used to control machines high scale computers scientists figured out how to make and use digital computers in the s to s scientists made a lot of digital computers and as they did they figured out how to ask them the right sorts of questions to get the most out of them here are a few of the computers they built edsac was one of the first computers that remembered what you told it even after you turned the power off this is called von neumann architecture konrad zuse s electromechanical z machines the z was the first working machine that used binary arithmetic binary arithmetic means using yes and no to add numbers together you could also program it in the z was proved to be turing complete turing complete means that it is possible to tell this particular computer anything that it is mathematically possible to tell a computer it is the world s first modern computer the non programmable atanasoff berry computer which used vacuum tubes to store yes and no answers and regenerative capacitor memory the harvard mark i a big computer that you could kind of program the u s army s ballistics research laboratory eniac which could add numbers the way people do using the numbers through and is sometimes called the first general purpose electronic computer since konrad zuse s z of used electromagnets instead of electronics at first however the only way to reprogram eniac was by rewiring it several developers of eniac saw its problems they invented a way to for a computer to remember what they had told it and a way to change what it remembered this is known as stored program architecture or von neumann architecture john von neumann talked about this design in the paper first draft of a report on the edvac distributed in a number of projects to develop computers based on the stored program architecture started around this time the first of these was completed in great britain the first to be demonstrated working was the manchester small scale experimental machine ssem or baby while the edsac completed a year after ssem was the first really useful computer that used the stored program design shortly afterwards the machine originally described by von neumann s paper edvac was completed but was not ready for two years nearly all modern computers use the stored program architecture it has become the main concept which defines a modern computer the technologies used to build computers have changed since the s but many current computers still use the von neumann architecture microprocessors are miniaturized devices that often implement stored program cpus in the s computers were built out of mostly vacuum tubes transistors replaced vacuum tubes in the s because they were smaller and cheaper they also need less power and do not break down as much as vacuum tubes in the s technologies were based on integrated circuits microprocessors such as the intel made computers smaller cheaper faster and more reliable by the s microcontrollers became small and cheap enough to replace mechanical controls in things like washing machines the s also saw home computers and personal computers with the evolution of the internet personal computers are becoming as common as the television and the telephone in the household in nokia started to call some of its mobile phones the n series multimedia computers and after the launch of the apple iphone in many are now starting to add the smartphone category among real computers in if smartphones are included in the numbers of computers in the world the biggest computer maker by units sold was no longer hewlett packard but rather nokia kinds of computers there are many types of computers some include personal computer workstation mainframe server minicomputer supercomputer embedded system tablet computer a desktop computer is a small machine that has a screen which is not part of the computer most people keep them on top of a desk which is why they are called desktop computers laptop computers are computers small enough to fit on your lap this makes them easy to carry around both laptops and desktops are called personal computers because one person at a time uses them for things like playing music surfing the web or playing video games there are bigger computers that many people at a time can use these are called mainframes and these computers do all the things that make things like the internet work you can think of a personal computer like this the personal computer is like your skin you can see it other people can see it and through your skin you feel wind water air and the rest of the world a mainframe is more like your internal organs you never see them and you barely even think about them but if they suddenly went missing you would have some very big problems an embedded computer also called embedded system is a computer that does one thing and one thing only and usually does it very well for example an alarm clock is an embedded computer it tells the time unlike your personal computer you cannot use your clock to play tetris because of this we say that embedded computers cannot be programmed because you cannot install more programs on your clock some mobile phones automatic teller machines microwave ovens cd players and cars are operated by embedded computers all in one pc all in one computers are desktop computers that have all of the computer s inner mechanisms in the same case as the monitor apple has made several popular examples of all in one computers such as the original macintosh of the mid s and the imac of the late s and s common uses of home computers playing computer games writing solving math problems watching tv and movies listening to music communicating with other people sending e mail using the internet video and photo editing recording sound or video taking pictures photography drawing common uses of work computers word processing spreadsheets powerpoint presentations photo editing e mail video editing rendering encoding audio recording system management software development working methods computers store data and the instructions as numbers because computers can do things with numbers very quickly these data are stored as binary symbols s and s a or a symbol stored by a computer is called a bit which comes from the words binary digit computers can use many bits together to represent instructions and the data that these instructions use a list of instructions is called a program and is stored on the computer s hard disk computers work through the program by using a central processing unit and they use fast memory called ram also known as random access memory as a space to store the instructions and data while they are doing this when the computer wants to store the results of the program for later it uses the hard disk because things stored on a hard disk can still be remembered after the computer is turned off an operating system tells the computer how to understand what jobs it has to do how to do these jobs and how to tell people the results millions of computers may be using the same operating system while each computer can have its own application programs to do what its user needs using the same operating systems makes it easy to learn how to use computers for new things a user who needs to use a computer for something different can learn how to use a new application program some operating systems can have simple command lines or a fully user friendly gui the internet one of the most important jobs that computers do for people is helping with communication communication is how people share information computers have helped people move forward in science medicine business and learning because they let experts from anywhere in the world work with each other and share information they also let other people communicate with each other do their jobs almost anywhere learn about almost anything or share their opinions with each other the internet is the thing that lets people communicate between their computers computers and waste a computer is now almost always an electronic device it usually contains materials that will become electronic waste when discarded when a new computer is bought in some places laws require that the cost of its waste management must also be paid for this is called product stewardship computers can become obsolete quickly depending on what programs the user runs very often they are thrown away within two or three years because some newer programs require a more powerful computer this makes the problem worse so computer recycling happens a lot many projects try to send working computers to developing nations so they can be re used and will not become waste as quickly as most people do not need to run new programs some computer parts such as hard drives can break easily when these parts end up in the landfill they can put poisonous chemicals like lead into the ground water hard drives can also contain secret information like credit card numbers if the hard drive is not erased before being thrown away an identity thief can get the information from the hard drive even if the drive doesn t work and use it to steal money from the previous owner s bank account main hardware computers come in different forms but most of them have a common design all computers have a cpu all computers have some kind of data bus which lets them get inputs or output things to the environment all computers have some form of memory these are usually chips integrated circuits which can hold information many computers have some kind of sensors which lets them get input from their environment many computers have some kind of display device which lets them show output they may also have other peripheral devices connected a computer has several main parts when comparing a computer to a human body the cpu is like a brain it does most of the thinking and tells the rest of the computer how to work the cpu is on the motherboard which is like the skeleton it provides the basis for where the other parts go and carries the nerves that connect them to each other and the cpu the motherboard is connected to a power supply which provides electricity to the entire computer the various drives cd drive floppy drive and on many newer computers usb flash drive act like eyes ears and fingers and allow the computer to read different types of storage in the same way that a human can read different types of books the hard drive is like a human s memory and keeps track of all the data stored on the computer most computers have a sound card or another method of making sound which is like vocal cords or a voice box connected to the sound card are speakers which are like a mouth and are where the sound comes out computers might also have a graphics card which helps the computer to create visual effects such as d environments or more realistic colors and more powerful graphics cards can make more realistic or more advanced images in the same way a well trained artist can largest computer companies company name sales us billion apple samsung foxconn hp hewlett packard ibm

the third alternative is the term australasia which includes at least all countries on the australian continental plate this includes the islands of new guinea tasmania new zealand and a number of smaller islands it is on the south eastern side of the wallace line with distinct differences in its biology from the asian side of the line it includes all the islands of the malay archipelago as well as the various groups of islands in the pacific the term has been used in very different senses north and south america north america and south america are often described as the americas this has the advantage of including central america and the caribbean islands otherwise central america is counted as part of north america eurasia eurasia is not really an alternative it is a recognition that the landmass of europe and asia are continuous and some of its largest countries are in both continents russia extends from eastern europe to the far east of asia without a break the ural mountains which run roughly north south are the traditional dividing line between europe and asia for many purposes it is convenient to consider the great landmass as a single continent eurasia when british people talk about the continent or continental things they mean the european mainland this meaning is not used as much as it used to be but is still seen in phrases like continental breakfast rolls with cheese jam etc as distinct from an english breakfast which is a cooked breakfast continents not only move but also sometimes move against each other the indian subcontinent has been colliding with the eurasian continent for a while now as these continents push against each other they buckle and bend because of this the himalaya mountains where mount everest is are still being

taiwan penghu kinmen and matsu the people s republic of china prc since commonly known as china has control over mainland china and the largely self governing territories of hong kong since and macau since china is one of the world s oldest civilizations it has the oldest continuous civilization there is archaeological evidence over years old china also has one of the world s oldest writing systems and the oldest in use today china has been the source of many major inventions origins the first recorded use of the word china is dated it is derived from chn a persian adjective meaning chinese which was popularized in europe by marco polo history ancient b c a d ancient china was one of the first civilizations and was active since the nd millennium bc as a feudal society chinese civilization was also one of the few to invent writing with the others being mesopotamia the indus valley civilization the maya civilization the minoan civilization of ancient greece and ancient egypt it reached its golden age during the tang dynasty c a d th century home of confucianism and daoism it had great influence on nearby countries including japan korea and vietnam in the areas of political system philosophy religion art writing and literature china is home to some of the oldest artwork in the world statues and pottery as well as decorations made of jade are some classic examples before the qin dynasty united china there were hundreds of small states that fought each other for hundreds of years in a war to control china this is known as the warring states period although the continuing wars made people suffer it was at this time when many great philosophies were born including confucianism and daoism confucianism and daoism alone have been the foundation of many social values seen in modern eastern asian cultures today its geography mostly looked like that of modern china except with northern and western edges that varied it was often attacked by northern nomadic people such as the turkic peoples and the mongols led by genghis khan and kublai khan during the history of ancient china the northern nomadic people and the chinese people had been fighting each other and taking turns to rule the land and the people of china however when the northern people beat the chinese people and came to rule the kingdom they also incorporated the chinese way of living and became like the chinese many of the strongest dynasties of china were ruled by the northern people including the qin tang yuan mongolian and qing each time they also brought new elements into the chinese culture a new age while china achieved many things in the first millennium and early nd millennium it became an isolationist country in the th century c e this was because spain found enormous silver in the new continent which was the main currency money in china and europe at the time and china did not want to be bought by the foreigners by the time of the renaissance european powers started to take over other countries in asia while china was never actually taken over many european countries such as britain and france built spheres of influence in china since china had cut itself off from the world over the previous few centuries by the qing dynasty it had fallen behind other countries in technology and was helpless to stop this from happening this had become clear when it lost the opium wars to britain in the th century still influenced by western sources china faced internal strife the taiping rebellion or taiping war occurred in china from through the taiping rebellion was led by hong xiuquan from guangdon hong xiuquan was influenced by christian missionaries and declared himself the brother of jesus hong made his mission to bring down the qing dynasty gaining influence on the southern chinese population the taiping rebellion attracted tens of thousands of supporters the taiping regime successfully created a state within the qing empire with the capital at nanjing hong called his new state the taiping tianguo or the heavenly state of great peace local armies eventually suppressed the rebellion at the final battle of nanjing in the republic of china was founded by sun yat sen but its government was very weak warlords controlled many areas chiang kai shek led wars against them and he became president and dictator in japan invaded manchuria a place in the northeastern part of china on july the japanese attacked the rest of the country starting what was called the second sino japanese war the war later became part of world war ii the war was fought for eight years and millions of chinese people were killed however the chinese civil war later started between the kuomintang nationalists of the republic of china roc and the communists of the people s republic of china prc the communists wanted to make china like the soviet union whereas the other side wanted to keep china in its current state at the time the communists were led by mao zedong liu shaoqi and others later liu lost influence with mao and his death to this day remains unresolved the communists eventually won the war the nationalists led by chiang kai shek fled to the island of taiwan and set up their new capital city in taipei after the chinese civil war the communist leader mao zedong declared a new country the people s republic of china prc in beijing on october under mao the country stayed poor while taiwan became richer his attempt at industrialization and collectivization with the great leap forward led to the deaths of many people from famine the cultural revolution caused great social upheaval after china underwent market economy reforms under deng xiaoping and experienced rapid economic growth china is now one of the largest economies in the world relying mainly on exports in recent history china has had problems with protests blocking of information on the internet and censorship of news was notable for the controversial tian an men massacre geography kppen geiger climate classification map for china china s landscape is vast and diverse it ranges from the gobi and taklamakan deserts in the north to subtropical forests in the south the himalaya karakoram pamir and tian shan mountain ranges separate china from much of south and central asia the yangtze and yellow rivers run from the tibetan plateau to the densely populated eastern coast the yangtze river is the third longest river in the world while the yellow river is the sixth longest china s coastline along the pacific ocean is kilometers mi long it is bounded by the bohai yellow east china and south china seas china connects through the kazakh border to the eurasian steppe the eurasian steppe has been an artery of communication between east and west since the neolithic through the steppe route the steppe route is the ancestor of the terrestrial silk road s politics the great hall of the people where the national people s congress is held the zhongnanhai a headquarter of the chinese government and communist party of china china s constitution states that the people s republic of china is a socialist

science and technology earliest known written formula for gunpowder from the wujing zongyao of ce china was once a world leader in science and technology up until the ming dynasty there are many ancient chinese discoveries and inventions for example papermaking printing the compass and gunpowder are known as the four great inventions they became widespread across east asia the middle east and later to europe chinese mathematicians were the first to use negative numbers by the th century europe and the western world became better than china in science and technology demographics the

wudang mountains martial art started more for the purpose of survival defense and warfare than art over time some art forms have branched off while others have retained their distinct chinese flavor china has had renowned artists including wong fei hung huang fei hung or hwang fei hung and many others art has also co existed with a variety of paints including the more standard colors legendary and controversial moves like big mak are also praised and talked about within the culture china has many traditional festivals such as spring festival dragon boat festival mid autumn festival and so on the most important is chinese new year people in china will have holidays to celebrate these festivals festivals spring festival is the chinese new year dragon boat festival is celebrated to commemorate the death of qu yuan a patriotic poet of the state of chu during the warring states period he persuaded his emperor not to accept qin s diplomats offers several times but his emperor did not listen to him he was very sad and ended up jumping into the river to end his life the people loved him so much that they did not want the fish to eat his corpse they made and threw rice dumplings into the river they hope the fish eat these dumplings instead of the poet s corpse they also rowed dragon boats in the river to get rid of the fish such practices eating rice dumplings and holding dragon boat races become what chinese do in this festival nowadays held on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month mid autumn festival is a festival for families now when the festival sets in people would sit together to eat moon cakes appreciate the bright full moon cakes appreciate the bright full moon celebrate the bumper harvest and enjoy the family love and happiness to the chinese people the full moon symbolizes family reunion as does the moon cakes hence the mid autumn festival is also called the family reunion festival notes footnotes references other websites map of china city photo gallery of china china citizendium world map with the current political division of countries as defined by montevideo convention a country is a territory with distinct political boundaries that claims sovereignty over a specific geographic area with a permanent population controlled by its own government that enters relations with other states there is no universally accepted answer as to how many countries in the world there actually are however the minimum answer is for the united nations members there are many advancements that can be made on this number for example there are two united nations observer states the vatican city state and the state of palestine this would add two to the list of united nations member states there for the number of countries the would be taiwan is also sometimes classified as a country however there is an ongoing disputes over taiwan s sovereignty with the peoples republic of china this can be developed on even further by adding the constituent countries of the united kingdom the kingdom of the netherlands and the kingdom of denmark which could add anywhere from three to eleven countries to the prior number there are a number of disputed areas that have declared independence from their parent state and receive limited recognition for example kosovo south ossetia transistria and abkhazia these are just some of the many examples of terrirories with limited to no recognition that are sometimes classed as countries there is a lot of controversy surrounding the above examples and quite often any one of these territories may be counted as countries purely based on opinion if all of the above were added the list of u n members there could be anything up to countries based on the previous examples given there are however many more territories with unique political circumstances that could also be counted depending on how loosely the dictionary definition for the word country is used there could be anything from countries in the world or more the matter is purely subjective depending on varying opinions and there has never been any consideration as to what the maximum number of countries in the world could be there are multipule organisations that have their own lists of countries one example being the travellers century club which recognises countries as of constituent country constituent country is a term sometimes used usually by official institutions in contexts in which a number of countries compose a long entity or grouping the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd has used the term referring to the former yugoslavia and the european institutions like the council of europe often use it in reference to the european union territorial dispute a disputed territory is that territory whose sovereignty is jealously desired by two or more countries usually the administration of the territory is carried out by one of the countries that claims sovereignty while the other country does not recognize the sovereignty over the territory of the other country this does not usually happen in land or sea areas on which none possesses effective control such as antarctica or only partially it can also be considered as a disputed territory to those areas that are given by two different governments and therefore are divided one example is the turkish republic of northern

cia world factbook cartography is making maps it is part of geography how people make maps is always changing in the past maps were drawn by hand but today most printed maps are made using computers and people usually see maps on computer screens someone who makes maps is called a cartographer making a map can be as simple as drawing a direction on a napkin or as complicated as showing a whole country or world anyone can make a map but cartographers spend their lives learning how to make better maps for many centuries maps were usually carefully drawn onto paper or parchment nowadays they are made on a computer which makes them look neater with accurate images maps are of two main types general maps with a variety of features thematic maps with particular themes for specific audiences general maps are produced in a series governments produce them in larger scale and smaller scale maps of great detail thematic maps are now very common they are necessary to show spatial cultural and social data references a creator is a person who creates something in some religions judaism christianity islam god or allah meaning the god in arabic is the most important and original creator of the whole universe including man who is made in his image see genesis to observe it and control it like god the idea that anything that a person is creating like an idea can be owned as property comes from the ethical traditions and legal codes that came from these religions in other traditions buddhism native american mythology anyone has this potential for creating and can become part of the greater creating of the universe stewardship of home land and all of earth is a test for participating in this or just good sense thumb chorizo is a pork pig meat sausage which people first made in the iberian peninsula it is made with large pieces of fatty pork chili pepper and paprika the special taste of this sausage comes from the mild spanish paprika in it in the western hemisphere the mexican and caribbean types are better known these types of chorizo are made with smaller pieces of pork and different seasonings and peppers are used cured smoked chorizo is edible and can be eaten without cooking fresh chorizo must be cooked before eating it can be eaten by its self or as part of meal it can also be used in place of ground beef or pork creativity is the ability of a person or group to make something new and useful or valuable or the process of making something new and useful or valuable it happens in all areas of life science art literature and music as a personal ability it is very difficult to measure the reason is that we don t understand the mental processes that help some people be more creative than others judging what is creative is also controversial some people say only things which are historically new are creative while other people say that if it is new for the creator and the people around them then it is also creativity some think creativity is an important thing that makes humans different from apes others recognize that even apes other primates other mammals and some birds adapt to survive by being creative for example primates using tools liane gabora believes that all culture comes from creativity not imitation therefore these people say human science should focus on it pay special attention to it ethics for example would focus on finding creative solutions to ethical dilemmas politics would focus on the political virtues that need some creativity imitation would not be the focus of education linguistics might be more interested in how new words are created by culture rather than in how existing ones are used in grammar intellectual interests recognized as intellectual rights or intellectual property in the law are a way to reward creativity in law but they do not always work very well a good example is copyright which is supposed to pay authors and artists but may only pay lawyers to make imitative arguments in court creativity is a central question in economics where it is known as ingenuity the ability to come up with new ideas or individual capital capacities that individuals have that do not arise from simple imitation of what is known already this is separate from the instructional capital that might try to capture some of that in a patent or training system that helps others do what the individual leader or founder of the system can do in urban economics there are various ways to measure creativity the bohemian index and gay index are two attempts to do this accurately and predict the economic growth of cities based on creativity for information on creativity see practical creative ideas and tools the cathars are expelled from carcassonne in the year the lower older part of castle peyrepertuse this castle was one of the last cathar strongholds to fall the cathar faith was a version of christianity they were usually considered gnostics the word cathar comes the greek word katharos meaning unpolluted from tobias churton the gnostics or the pure ones principles the cathars believed that the world had been made by a bad god they believed that this bad god had taken them from the good god and put them in the world but inside their bodies there was a spirit and that spirit needed to return to the good god they were famous for a belief in a form of reincarnation and believed that when someone died the bad god would put that person s spirit in a new body they believed this cycle of coming back to life could be escaped by a ritual cleansing they were opposed to the doctrine of sin women were prominent in the faith they were pacifists they didn t eat anything that was made from other animals including meat and cows milk the only exception to this was fish fish was ok to eat because they believed fishes were not alive but just things that were sometimes produced from dirt and water they preached tolerance of other faiths they rejected the usual christian rules of marriage and only believed in the new testament an earlier th century bulgarian heresy bogomilism and also manichaeism started some of these trends language they used a bible in the language people spoke many other christians used a bible in latin latin was spoken only by the priests problems in open challenge to catholic dominance began in about the first cathars said that the church was full of ravening starving wolves and hypocrites and worshipping the wrong god right in front of the most powerful catholics in the council of oxford in england wiped out the english cathars it was also suppressed in northern france in cathar bishops met to discuss organizing a counter church in the south of france the languedoc nobles protected it and many noble women became perfects parish clergy had low morale or confidence reactions the catholic church was against catharism seeing it as a heresy in the south of france there was tremendous religious fervor and an economy that was starting to grow and a social class of merchants and peasants was starting to grow peasants owned their own land meanwhile in other parts of europe peasants were forced to give up their land to nobles and become serfs or slaves the system of feudalism there was a strong central absolute monarchy that did not exist in the south of france the burghers and bankers had more power in this looser system r i moore is a historian who believes that it was desire to crush this system and take over the land that drove the attack however there was real cultural and religious difference to cause problems troubadors who combined some of the traditions of the bards of the celts and jews were both part of the multicultural society in the south of france their influences were not appreciated by local or roman church figures the th century roman catholic monks were founding their monasteries outside the towns drawing the best people there results the cathars thus had little competition the cathar perfects the so called good men or good women lived restrained lives and spread their faith in towns where the catholics in general did not have their best agents also cathars preached that only these good leaders had to follow the regimens their whole lives lay people could repent only on their deathbeds many th century christian sects have similar beliefs the albigensian crusade battle of muret methods the pope ordered a crusade against the cathars in southern france he said any crusader who answered the call would be given the same rewards as a crusader who went to the holy land this was an absolution of all sin in the launguedoc on the nd of july a force of about crusaders arrived at the walls of beziers bearing the cross pattee to mislead and create ease among the cathars thinking they were friend not foe and demanded that about cathars be surrendered the people of the town who were mostly catholic said that rather than turn over their friends and family we would rather be flayed alive a mistake by the defenders of beziers let thousands of attackers in arnauld amaury made the famous quote kill them all god knows his own on being asked how to tell who were cathars during the assault everyone in the town was killed some while taking refuge in the church it is guessed that were killed many of whom were catholics and not cathars at all the crusade became known as the albigensian crusade after the town of albi it was to wipe out the cathars almost entirely over forty or so years the crusaders wanted to go home but were ordered by the pope to continue until the whole south of france was controlled and all cathars were dead in they attacked the fortress at minerv and built the first great bonfire of heretics beginning the practice of burning at the stake that would continue in the inquisition of the counter reformation it is interesting to note that at the siege of montsegur when the fires were lit the cathars ran down the hill and threw themselves on as their beliefs were very strong result catharism disappeared from the northern italian cities after the s pressured by the inquisition the last known cathar perfectus in the languedoc guillaume

physics though the word cosmology is recent first used in in christian wolff s cosmologia generalis the study of the universe has a long history history until recently people thought that the universe

follows applies mostly to the historical practice of the church of england a church is a building that was constructed to allow people to meet to worship together these people are usually christians or influenced by christianity some other religious groups also call their religious buildings churches depending on the number of people that are in a community the churches come in different sizes small churches are called chapels the churches in a particular geographical area form a group called the diocese each diocese has a cathedral in most cases the cathedral is a very big church cathedrals are the seat of bishops history of church buildings an old english church showing saxon architecture rounded end aberlady church near edinburgh scotland small church in ohio lindenberg church near berlin germany is a th century church inside the transept of the cathedral of vora portugal speyer cathedral the largest romanesque building still in existence la madeleine paris is one of the main sights in paris france in the early days of christianity people had to worship in secret christian worship was not allowed in the roman empire so christians had to meet in a secret place sometimes they met in people s houses or barns sometimes they met underground the first places that were built for christian worship were small chapels that were cut into a rock where people could worship without being discovered after the death of the roman emperor constantine in a d christians were allowed to have buildings to worship in these first churches were built on a similar plan to roman basilicas this plan was later used for the fine gothic cathedrals and churches that were built at the end of the middle ages the parts of a church there are several parts in the architecture of a church not all churches will have all these parts the nave is the main part of the church where the congregation the people who come to worship sit the aisles are the sides of the church which may run along the side of the nave the transept if there is one is an area which crosses the nave near the top of the church this makes the church shaped like a cross which is a symbol of jesus s death on a cross the chancel leads up to the altar at the top of the church the altar is in the sanctuary the word sanctuary means sacred place people were not allowed to be arrested in the sanctuary so they were safe the altar is usually at the east end of the church people in the church sit facing the altar we say that the church faces east churches will also have a tower or steeple usually at the west end if the church has a transept the tower may be above the centre of the transept in roman catholic churches there is always a stoup bowl of holy water near the entrance of the church this tradition comes from the fact that roman basilicas had a fountain for washing in front of the entrance the font is a bowl where people often babies are baptized this is also near the entrance of the church this is a symbol of the fact that it is welcoming the people into the christian church traditionally the nave has long benches for the congregation to sit on these are called pews some churches may now have replaced their pews with chairs so that they can be moved about for different occasions at the front of the nave is the pulpit where the priest preaches these talks are called sermons there is also a lectern like a large music stand from where the lessons the bible readings are read if there are aisles along the side of the nave there will be pillars which hold up the roof in large churches or cathedrals there may be a row of little arches along the top of these pillars this is called the triforium over the triforium is the clerestory which is a row of windows high up in the church wall the chancel is the most holy part of the church and this is why it is often separated from the nave by a screen which can be made of wood or stone or occasionally iron the congregation can see through the screen on the top of the screen there may be a cross this is called a rood pronounce like rude screen priests used to climb up a staircase to the top of the rood screen to read the epistle and the gospel sometimes people sang from there inside the chancel are the benches where the choir sit these are called choir stalls they are on both sides the two sides of the choir sit facing one another the choir members who sit on the left north side are called cantoris the side where the cantor sits and those on the right south side are called decani the side where the deacon sits in some large churches or cathedrals the seats for the priests tip up the top of these seats when they are tipped up are called misericords from the latin word for mercy this is because the priests or monks were able to lean against them when they got tired if they had to stand up for a long time sometimes there are holes in the walls of the screen so that the congregation can see through these are called squints if there is a recess in the wall it is called an aumbry it is a cupboard for communion wine and bread that have been consecrated by a priest the altar may be right at the east end of the church but in larger churches or cathedrals it is often much farther forward in that case the very east end is called an apse sometimes it is a separate chapel called the lady chapel churches through the ages the design of churches changed a lot during the course of history often churches were made bigger when this happened there may be a mixture of architectural styles these styles vary a lot in different countries english churches in english churches there were several different periods of architecture the saxon period was a time when churches were very simple the end of the church end of the sanctuary was often rounded hardly any are left now because they were mostly made of wood the norman period came from the style called romanesque which was popular in europe the arches had ornaments which were called mouldings the tops of the pillars looked like cushions so they were called cushion capitals the windows were narrow and rounded at the top early english or gothic architecture was not as solid and heavy as norman architecture towers were elegant and tall like the tower of salisbury cathedral the decorated style of architecture was popular at a time when the plague black death was raging and a third of the people in england died for that reason not so much building was done then there were lots of stone carvings were made in churches at that time the perpendicular style was very grand it had lots of straight upward lines and fan vaulting this can be seen in westminster abbey and king s college chapel cambridge many churches that can be seen in england were built in this period in the s churches were built in a variety of styles often they copied some of the older styles after the great fire of london many new churches were built by the architect sir christopher wren they were built in the classical style churches continued to be built in later centuries like this but also the gothic style continued to be used modern churches often do not have the traditional cross shape it is difficult for the congregation to see and hear what is happening in the chancel modern churches bring the congregation choir and priests in closer touch an example is the round design for the church of christ the cornerstone in milton keynes modern churches are often simpler but with a warmer character than the gothic churches many have beautiful mosaic glass windows coventry cathedral is a famous example of a modern church building related pages cathedral chapel choir music references encyclopdia britannica other websites virtual church the medieval city of sienna with its town square and magnificent town hall a modern suburb can be seen in the background a city is a place where many people live together a city has many buildings and streets it has houses or apartments for many people to live shops where they may buy things places for people to work and a government organisation to run the city and to keep law and order in the city people live in cities because it is easy for them to find and do the things they want there a city usually has a city centre where government and business take place and places called suburbs where people live around the outside of the centre definition tirana capital of albania there is no rule that is used all over the world to decide why some places are called city and other places are called town some things that make a city are a long history although many cities today have only been around for tens or hundreds of years there are a few which have been so for thousands of years for example athens greece was founded in bc and rome italy has existed since bc a large population cities can have millions of people living in and around them among them is tokyo japan and the tokyo metropolis around it which includes yokohama and chiba a centre where business and government takes place the first case is often described as the financial capital such as frankfurt in germany the second case is true for different levels of government whether they are local or part of a larger region for example atlanta georgia or an entire country for example washington d c cities which contain the government of the region it is in are called capitals almost every country has its own capital special powers called town privileges which have been given by the government of the country or its ruler this was done especially in europe during the middle ages having a cathedral or a university this rule is found in the united kingdom the smallest cathedral cities are st david s and st asaph s which are both in wales and ripon and wells which are in england in american english people often call all places where many people live cities see below size of cities size of cities the river thames is part of london s transport system this picture shows the city of london tokyo is the world s most populous metropolitan area the sizes of cities can be very different this depends on the type of city that it is cities that were built hundreds of years ago and which have not changed much are very much smaller than modern cities there are two main reasons one reason is that old cities often have a city wall and most of the city is inside it another important reason is that the streets in old cities are often narrow if the city got too big it was hard for a cart carrying food to get to the market place people in cities need food and the food always has to come from outside the city cities that were on a river like london could grow much bigger than cities that were on a mountain like sienna in italy because the river made a transport route for carrying food and other goods as well as for transporting people london has been changing continually for hundreds of years while siena which was a very important city in the s has changed very little in years modern cities with modern transport systems can grow very large because the streets are wide enough for cars buses and trucks and there are often railway lines as well in the us the word city is often used for towns that are not very big when the first european people went to america they gave the name city to new places they hoped the places would be great cities in the future for example salt lake city was the name given to a village of people when they started building the town they made street plans and called it great salt lake city for the nearby great salt lake now years later it really is a big city in modern times many cities have grown bigger and bigger the whole area is often called a metropolis and can sometimes includes several small ancient towns and villages the metropolis of london includes the city of london the city of westminster and many old villages such as notting hill southwark richmond greenwich and etc the part that is officially known as the city of london only takes up one square mile the rest is known as greater london many other cities have grown in the same way these giant cities can be exciting places to live and many people can find good jobs there but modern cities also have many problems many people cannot find jobs in the cities and have to get money by begging or by crime cars factories and waste create a lot of pollution that makes people sick the smallest city is urban historycarcassonne is an ancient city in france urban history is

daro benares in northern india is one among the ancient cities which has a history of more years other cities that have existed since ancient times are athens in greece rome and volterra in italy alexandria in egypt and york in england in europe in the middle ages being a city was a special privilege granted by nobility cities that fall into this category usually had or still have city walls the people who lived in the city were privileged over those who did not medieval cities that still have walls include carcassonne in france tehran in iran toledo in spain and canterbury in england in the united kingdom a city is a town which people have always called a city or which has got the name city status by royal charter a special paper from the king or queen cities usually get this because they have a special number of people or are important in the past cities got that name if they had a cathedral or a university some cathedral cities for example st david s are small and people do not normally think of them as cities cities that became cities because of their university generally grow because more people move there to be educated at the university colleges the university cities of

some foods are good to eat raw other foods are not good for the body when they are raw so they must be cooked some foods are good to eat either raw or cooking methods cooking is often done in a kitchen using a stove or an oven it can also be done over a fire for example over a campfire or on a barbecue the heat for cooking can be made in different ways it can be from an open fire that burns wood or charcoal it can be on a stove or in an oven that uses propane natural gas or electricity there are several different ways to cook food boiling cooks food in hot water frying deep or shallow cooks food in hot butter fat or oil baking and roasting cook food by surrounding it with hot air grilling means cooking food on a metal grill that has heat under it people often cook meat by boiling roasting frying or grilling it some foods such as bread or pastries are usually baked usually food is cooked in some kind of pot or pan sometimes people cook food by putting it directly into the fire or by wrapping the food in leaves before they put it into the fire cooks left a person whose job it is to cook food may be called a cook or a chef the word cooker means a machine or tool that a cook

heon x a crime or misdemeanor or felony is an act done by a person which is against the laws of a country or region a person who does this is called a criminal the basic idea of what things are called crimes is that they are thought to be things that might cause a problem for another person things like killing another person injuring another person or stealing from another person are crimes in most countries also it can be a crime to have or sell contraband such as guns or illegal drugs when some criminals make money from crime they try to stop the police finding out where the money came from by money laundering men and boys commit many more crimes than women and girls levels of crime there are various levels of crimes in some jurisdictions they are misdemeanor a minor crime typically punished by a fee or less than year in jail felony or high crime a major crime typically punished by year or longer in prison different countries have different ideas of what things are crimes and which ones are the worst some things that are crimes in one country are not crimes in other countries many countries get their ideas of what things are crimes from religions or controversial events which cause a law to be quickly created for example a religious taboo might say eating a particular food is a crime when automobiles became numerous they killed or hurt many people in road accidents so new laws were made for them in many countries if people say they made or wrote a book movie song or web page that they did not really make or write it is a crime against copyright laws in many countries helping to grow make move or sell illegal drugs is a crime in most countries police try to stop crimes and to find criminals when the police find someone who they think might be a criminal they usually hold the person in a jail then usually a court or a judge decides if the person really did a crime if the court or judge decides that the person really did it then he or she might have to pay a fine or go to prison sometimes the judge might decide that the criminal should be executed killed this is called capital punishment or the death penalty there are countries in the world that execute criminals and others that do not in many countries two conditions must exist for an act to be criminal mens rea occurs when the offence is committed with intent or knowledge or recklessness guilty mind actus rea a wrongful deed both must be present for the act to be considered a crime references time cube is a website created by gene ray on that website dr ray explains his time cube

people in ancient central america it is now the third most important cereal crop in the world however little of this maize is eaten directly by humans most is used to make corn ethanol animal feed and other maize products such as corn starch and corn syrup maize is a leafy stalk whose kernels have seeds inside it is an angiosperm which means that its seeds are enclosed inside a fruit or shell it is has long been a staple food by many people in mexico central and south america and parts of africa in europe and the rest of north america maize is grown mostly for use as animal feed in canada and the united states maize is commonly referred to as corn centuries of cross breeding have produced larger plants and specialized varieties corn has become an important ingredient in american foods through the use of corn starch people have long eaten sweet corn and popcorn with little processing and other kinds after processing into flour for making cornbread tortillas and other artificial foods maize has been a fruitful model organism for research in genetics for many years see barbara mcclintock research has shown that artificial selection developed maize from a mexican plant called teosinte the genus zea there are five species and many subspecies in the genus they are all plants similar to the cultivated maize with less developed cobs the wild ones are sometimes called teosintes

civics can be grouped as anarchist capitalist democrat green libertarian republican calculus is a branch of mathematics which helps us understand changes between values that are related by a function for example if you had one formula telling how much money you got every day calculus would help you understand related formulas like how much money you have in total and whether you are getting more money or less than you used to all these formulas are functions of time and so that is one way to think of calculus studying functions of time there are two different types of calculus differential calculus divides things into small different pieces and tells us how they change from one moment to the next while integral calculus joins integrates the small pieces together and tells us how much of something is made overall by a series of changes calculus is used in many different areas such as physics astronomy biology engineering economics medicine and sociology history in the s and s sir isaac newton in england and gottfried leibniz in germany figured out calculus at the same time working separately from each other newton wanted to have a new way to predict where to see planets in the sky because astronomy had always been a popular and useful form of science and knowing more about the motions of the objects in the night sky was important for navigation of ships leibniz wanted to measure the space area under a curve a line which is not straight many years later the two men argued over who discovered it first scientists from england supported newton but scientists from the rest of europe supported leibniz most mathematicians today agree that both men share the credit equally some parts of modern calculus come from newton such as its uses in physics other parts come from leibniz such as the symbols used to write it they were not the first people to use mathematics to describe the physical world aristotle and pythagoras came earlier and so did galileo galilei who said that mathematics was the language of science but both newton and leibniz were the first to design a system that describes how things change over time and can predict how they will change in the future the name calculus was the latin word for a small stone the ancient romans used in counting and gambling the english word calculate comes from the same latin word differential calculus differential calculus is the process of finding out the rate of change of a variable compared to another variable it can be used to find the speed of a moving object or the slope of a curve figure out the maximum or minimum points of a curve or find answers to problems in the electricity and magnetism areas of physics among many other uses many amounts can be variables which can change their value unlike numbers such as or some examples of variables are distance and time the speed of an object is how far it travels in a particular time so if a town is kilometres miles away and a person in a car gets there in one hour they have traveled at an average speed of kilometres miles per hour but this is only an average they may have been traveling faster at some times on a highway and slower at others at a traffic light or on a small street where people live imagine a driver trying to figure out a car s speed using only its odometer distance meter and clock without a speedometer until calculus was invented the only way to work this out was to cut the time into smaller and smaller pieces so the average speed over the smaller time would get closer and closer to the actual speed at a point in time this was a very long and hard process and had to be done each time people wanted to work something out tangents to the curve a very similar problem is to find the slope how steep it is at any point on a curve the slope of a straight line is easy to work out it is simply how much it goes up y or vertical divided by how much it goes across x or horizontal on a curve though the slope is a variable has different values at different points because the line bends but if the curve was to be cut into very very small pieces the curve at the point would look almost like a very short straight line so to work out its slope a straight line can be drawn through the point with the same slope as the curve at that point if it is done exactly right the straight line will have the same slope as the curve and is called a tangent but there is no way to know without very complicated mathematics whether the tangent is exactly right and our eyes are not accurate enough to be certain whether it is exact or simply very close what newton and leibniz found was a way to work out the slope or the speed in the distance example exactly using simple and logical rules they divided the curve into an infinite number of very small pieces they then chose points on either side of the range they were interested in and worked out tangents at each as the points moved closer together towards the point they were interested in the slope approached a particular value as the tangents approached the real slope of the curve the particular value it approached was the actual slope a picture that shows what x and x h mean on the curve let s say we have a function f is short for function so this equation means y is a function of x this tells us that how high y is on the vertical axis depends on what x the horizontal axis is at that time for example with the equation we know that if is then will be if is then will be if is then will be the derivative produced using this method here is or multiplied by so we know without having to draw any tangent lines that at any point on the curve the derivative marked with the prime symbol will be at any point this process of working out a slope using limits is called differentiation or finding the derivative the way to write the derivative in mathematics is leibniz came to the same result but called h which means with respect to x he called the resulting change in which means a tiny amount of y leibniz s notation is used by more books because it is easy to understand when the equations become more complicated in leibniz notation mathematicians have grown this basic theory to make simple algebra rules which can be used to find the derivative of almost any function integral calculus integration is about finding the area s given a b and y f x integral calculus is the process of calculating the area underneath a graph of a function an example is calculating the distance a car travels if you know the speed of the car at different points in time and draw a graph of this speed then the distance the car travels will be the area under the graph we can approximate the area under a curve by adding up the areas of many rectangles underneath the curve the more rectangles we use the better our approximation the way to do this is to divide the graph into many very small pieces and then draw very thin rectangles under each piece as the rectangles become thinner and thinner the rectangles cover the area underneath the graph better and better the area of a rectangle is easy to calculate so we can calculate the total area of all the rectangles for thinner rectangles this total area value approaches the area underneath the graph the final value of the area is called the integral of the function in mathematics the integral of the function f x from a to b is written as main idea of calculus the main idea in calculus is called the fundamental theorem of calculus this main idea says that the two calculus processes differential and integral calculus are opposites that is a person can use differential calculus to undo an integral calculus process also a person can use integral calculus to undo a differential calculus method this is just like using division to undo multiplication or addition to undo subtraction in a single sentence the fundamental theorem runs something like this the derivative of the integral of a function f is the function itself other uses of calculus calculus is used to describe things that change like things in nature it can be used for showing and learning all of these how waves move waves are very important in the natural world for example sound and light can be thought of as waves where heat moves like in a house this is useful for architecture building houses so that the house can be as cheap to heat as possible how very small things like atoms act how fast something will fall also known as gravity how machines work also known as mechanics the path of the moon as it moves around the earth also the path of the earth as it moves around the sun and any planet or moon moving around anything in space th century french coin a coin is normally a round piece of metal that is used as

are very different from asteroids the orbital inclinations of comets are usually high and not near the ecliptic where most solar system objects are found most of them are long period comets and come from the kuiper belt that is very far away from the sun but some of them also come near enough to earth for us to see at night they have long tails because the sun melts the ice a comet s tail does not trail behind it but points directly away from the sun because it is blown by the solar wind the hard centre of the comet is the nucleus it is one of the blackest things lowest albedo in the solar system when light shone on the nucleus of halley s comet the comet reflected only of the light back to us periodic comets visit again and again non periodic or single apparition comets visit only once

are broken pieces that used to be one object famous comets halley s comet hale bopp shoemaker levy ikeya seki history of comets in old times people used to be scared of comets they did not know what they were or where they came from some thought that they were fireballs sent from demons or gods to destroy the earth they said that each time a comet appeared it would bring bad luck with it whenever a comet appeared a king would die for example the bayeux tapestry shows the return of halley s comet and the death of a king comets were also known to end wars and thought to bring famine during the renaissance astronomers started to look at comets with less superstition and to base their science on observations tycho brahe reasoned that comets did not come from the earth and his calculations showed that comets must be six times farther than the earth is from the moon edmond halley reasoned that some comets are periodic that is they appear again after a certain number of years and again and again this led to the first prediction of a comet s return halley s comet named after him isaac newton also studied comets he realised that comets make u turns around the sun he asked his friend edmond halley to publish this in his book philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica before newton said this people believed that comets go in to the sun then another comes out from behind the sun in later years some astronomers thought comets were spit out by planets especially jupiter all this new information and research gave people confidence but some still thought that comets were messengers from the gods one th century vision said that comets were the places that hell was where souls would ride being burned up by the heat of the sun and frozen by the cold of space in modern

fields a christian is a person who believes in christianity a monotheistic religion christianity is mostly about the life and teachings of jesus christ in the new testament and interpreted of prophesied in the hebrew bible old testament christianity is the world s largest religion with billion followers around the world christians consider the holy bible to be a sacred book inspired by god the holy bible is a combination of the hebrew bible or torah and a collection of writings called the new testament views on the importance of these writings vary some christian groups prefer to favor the new testament while others believe the entire bible is equally important also while many christians prefer to consider the bible as true inspired by god not all groups believe that it is completely accurate some of these groups may think that the bible is a collection of stories meant to show who god is or even just the opinions of humans that reveal some commonly believed truth the issue of who is a christian can be very controversial christians often disagree over this issue due to their differences in opinion on spiritual matters it is not possible to provide a statement that all readers may agree with therefore a definition will not be provided even very traditional doctrines such as the belief that jesus christ is god or that god consists of the father son and spirit are not common to people who claim christianity as their religion many christians choose to go to church most christians believe this to be a sign of their religious devotion to god and an act of worship however some christian groups think that one can be a christian without ever going to a church though there are many different viewpoints on the issue most protestants believe all christians are part of the spiritual church of christ whether or not those christians go to an actual church each week on the other hand catholics believe that the holy catholic church is the only true church in some christian movements especially fundamentalism and evangelicalism to be a born again christian is to undergo a spiritual rebirth related pages christianity religion salvation references cheese cheese

milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice most cheeses are acidified by bacteria this bacteria turns milk sugars into lactic acid rennet is then used to finish the curdling vegetarian alternatives to rennet can also be used most of these are made by fermentation of a fungus called mucor miehei other alternatives use species of the cynara thistle family the origin of

points on the edge of the circle are at the same distance from the center the radius of a circle is a line from the centre of the circle to a point on the side mathematicians use the letter r for the length of a circle s radius the centre of a circle is the point in the very middle the diameter meaning all the way across of a circle is a straight line that goes from one side to the opposite and right through the centre of the circle mathematicians use the letter d for the length of this line the diameter of a circle is equal to twice its radius d equals times r the circumference meaning all the way around of a circle is the line that goes around the centre of the circle mathematicians use the letter c for the length of this line the number written as the greek letter pi is a very useful number it is the length of the circumference divided by the length of the diameter equals c divided by d as a fraction the number is equal to about or which is closer and as a number it is about the area of the circle is equal to times the area of the gray square the area a inside a circle is equal to the radius multiplied by itself then multiplied by a equals times r times r calculating can be measured by drawing a large circle then measuring its diameter d and circumference c this is because the circumference of a circle is always times its diameter can also be calculated by only using mathematical methods most methods used for calculating the value of have desirable mathematical properties however they are hard to understand without knowing trigonometry and calculus however some methods are quite simple such as this form of the gregory leibniz series while that series is easy to write and calculate it is not easy to see why it equals an easier to understand approach is to draw an imaginary circle of radius r centered at the origin then any point x y whose distance d from the origin is less than r calculated by the pythagorean theorem will be inside the circle finding a set of points inside the circle allows the circle s area a to be estimated for example by using integer coordinates for a big r since the area a of a circle is times the radius squared can be

in in guerilla fighters led by fidel castro and che guevara overthrew cuba s dictator fulgencio batista in what became the cuban revolution castro began making relations with the soviet union and tried to close a lot of american businesses in cuba the united states did not like this in castro officially announced that his government was socialist the us attempted to invade cuba to regain control of it and overthrow it s communist led government but failed the communist party of cuba was created in and has ruled the island ever since today cuba is the only communist state outside of asia in the caribbean and in the western hemisphere culture cuba is famous for many types of music especially dance music such as the salsa and mambo because cubans have ancestors from spain africa south america and north america cuban music is special and different reading is very popular in cuba many people especially enjoy reading books or things that come from outside the country even though the government does not approve of this they also love music and sports cuban music is very lively this is because a lot of it comes from african and spanish rhythms baseball basketball and athletics

cuba was conquered by the spaniards three tribes lived on the island they were the tanos the ciboneys and the guanajatabeyes the tanos were the largest and most common of the three tribes they farmed crops such as beans corn squash and yams the tanos also slept in hammocks which the spaniards would introduce to the rest of the world then in christopher columbus arrived in cuba on his first trip to the americas three years later he claimed the islands for the spanish the spanish began to rule cuba afterwards the spanish brought thousands of slaves from africa to cuba to work for them most of the native cubans died because of the new diseases brought by the spanish and africans the spanish also treated the native cubans very cruelly and massacred many of them the spanish ruled for many years cuba became the most important producer of sugar in the early s cubans rebelled against the spanish rulers but failed until when the united states went to war with the spanish and defeated them cuba became american for four years afterwards before it became an independent republic in even though cuba was independent the americans still controlled the island by a law called the platt amendment in the cubans stopped the platt amendment but the americans still had a big say in cuban politics americans owned most of cuba s businesses the americans supported the leader fulgencio batista who was seen by many cubans as corrupt in addition to political control the united states also exercised significant control over the cuban economy at the time cuba was a monoculture economy while they produced coffee tobacco and rice they relied primarily on sugar thus they were known by other countries as the sugar bowl of the world the united states bought sugar from the republic of cuba at a price higher than the global standard in exchange cuba was to give preference to the united states and its industries cuba depended on the united states and their investments cuba was not industrialized and needed the revenue for goods and oil they also needed the us investment for gas electricity communications railways and banks while cuban workers had better conditions than other countries in the continent they still faced inequality lack of infrastructure high illiteracy rates and a lack of full time work the sugar industry was seasonal cuban revolution in fidel castro led a revolution against fulgencio batista castro took power in cuba with che guevara from argentina his brother raul and others who fought against batista castro made many changes to cuba he ended american ownership of cuban businesses this made castro unpopular in america and the united states banned all contact with cuba many cubans went to america because of this in the americans helped some of these cubans to attack cuba and try to remove castro but they failed castro then asked the soviet union to help defend them from the americans which they did the soviet union put nuclear weapons in cuba and aimed them at the united states american president kennedy demanded that they be removed or a new war would begin this was known as the cuban missile crisis the soviet union removed the missiles when the united states agreed to not continue attacking cuba and to remove missiles from turkey cuba became a communist led country like the soviet union after this the soviet union bought most of cuba s sugar for expensive prices cuba spent this money on health education and the army this made cuba s schools and hospitals some of the best in the world the army fought in africa to support black africans against the white south african army cuba also supported groups in south america fighting against the dictators of those countries however the cuban government began to control most of life in cuba under the communist system disagreeing with the cuban government and fidel castro in public was not allowed some cubans did not like this and tried to leave cuba most cubans who left went to the united states some cubans who did not like the government and stayed were put in jail many groups from around the world protested against cuba because of this and demanded that fidel castro give up power in the soviet union collapsed this meant that cuba which had sold most of its products to the soviet union had no money coming into the country the americans made the restrictions against contact with cuba tighter america said the restrictions on contact would continue unless fidel castro gave up power cuba became very poor in the s this became known in cuba as the special period because of the disaster cuba changed to allow less control by the government more discussion amongst the people and private shops and businesses cuba also tried to get tourists to visit the island in the s tourism to cuba began to make money for the island again though fidel castro had remained in power he had passed all duties to his brother raul after an illness fidel castro was one of the longest serving heads of state in miguel daz canel became the official president of cuba in april historic talks took place with us president obama and cuban general secretary ral castro in improving

kongo and yoruba tribes there were also the igbos ewes fons fulas mandinkas and some others afro cubans range enormously from percent to percent of the population and they are mostly concentrated in the east parts of cuba these brought with them their instruments reigion santeria and customs to the cuban culture mediterranean cubans are about of the population however one must know that a lot of the southern spaniard cuban descendants have good portion of moor blood in their family lines due to the close proximate spain is to north africa many mediterranean cubans came during the s s and

egyptian dancing girls and musicians every known traditional culture has types of dance this is a zulu event ice dancing luca lanotte anna cappellini do the paso doble on ice astaire in dance company dance is a performing art it is described in many ways it is when people move to a musical rhythm they may be alone or in a group the dance may be an informal play a part of a ritual or a part of a professional performance there are many kinds of dances and every human society has its own dances dancing is not a sport though it does have some athletic aspects dance is an art some people dance to express their feelings and emotions other people dance to feel better dance can be used to tell a story in some societies dance goes with song as well as music people who want to learn to dance can go to dance schools it may take years of practice to become an experienced and flexible dancer to plan a dance is called choreography done by a choreographer often this goes with music and fits into a certain style dances may be planned in detail or they may be whatever dancers feel like doing however most dancing does follow some general style or pattern one style is the couple dance where usually a man and a woman dance together other dances need an ensemble a group of people together to make it work history people have always danced every society has its own dances there are pictures on pottery and stone which show dances from several thousand years ago in egypt and greece sachs divides early dances into imageless dances and image dances by imageless dances he meant dances which have no set form but aim at getting the dancers into a state of ecstasy in this state the dancer s seem changed in a trance and are often thought of by their society as being possessed by spirits these dances are done on certain occasions marriage war famine illness or death and so on they are found in all early primitive societies p the image dances according to sachs are to do with the world outside the dancer by imitating an animal or object the dancer believes he can capture a power and make it useful to dance in imitation of the animal which is going to be hunted is to become one with them to imitate the act of sex is to achieve fertility this is the kind of thinking behind an image dance sachs points out that societies of this kind do not really understand the connection between cause and effect they really believe the image dances work the dance type which is used in image dances is mime p the two styles of dance may be joined together fertility dances may involve both ecstatic states and mime the great dancer nijinsky used some of these ideas in his choreography for the ballet le sacre du printemps the rite of spring a ballet about the sacrifice of a girl during a primitive celebration of spring in more recent times the first dance school we know about was opened in in paris only men were accepted until after women were accepted too ballroom dances are forms of modern dance ballroom dances such as the waltz are done by couples until the th century most ballroom dances were sequence dances the way people moved was planned in set formation these formations were usually lines or squares everyone moved at the same time and finished at the same time the music played for a set time and then stopped after the invention of the waltz around another style of dancing developed in the waltz and later dances people danced in couples but they did so separately they did not dance in formation but moved round the room as they pleased but anti clockwise often new dance styles arrive some dance as individuals separately as they please street dance is like that all these types of dance have music at the same time round the world there are many traditional dances some of them have been going for hundreds of years we call them folkloric dances the coming of popular music videos and dvds led to a kind of dancer previously seen in some stage shows a backup dancer or background dancer is a performer who dances with or behind the lead performers in a live musical act or in a music video styles ballet silje does an arabesque by her father frode inge

references modern drawing of one of oliver cromwell s visitors leaving a monastery people think this could be colchester abbey after it was ruined the dissolution of the monasteries was an event that happened from to when english king henry viii took away the land and money that the nuns and monks of the roman catholic church owned henry viii then gave this land and money to people that supported him this was also when henry viii made himself the new head of the church of england which is a type of christianity parliament made the act of supremacy to give him the right to do both these things it was part of the protestant reformation in england a deadline is a time by which some task must be completed very often it means a time limit that is set in place by an authority for example a teacher tells students that they must turn in their homework in by a certain time this is so the teacher is able to report fairly to his or her principal that every student had the same chance to do the work deadlines may also be set by a time horizon that comes from something that is not a human authority but part of nature for example by sunset one must do those tasks requiring daylight however a human must watch the sun and decide what light is strong enough to still be daylight so time limits will still be involved even if one observes a horizon and sets a deadline oneself a way to remember this is that a time horizon is like the physical horizon where sunset happens and a time limit is a thing people set up to deal with this a deadline is a thing powerful people set up to ensure less powerful people comply with their way of doing things dutton speedwords is a made up language written by reginald john garfield dutton the idea of dutton speedwords is to make frequent words short and very frequent words very short dutton speedwords can be used as a second language for international communications dutton speedwords is also a shorthand writing system this means you can use it to write quickly the method was made up by reginald john garfield dutton in it was first published in it was called international symbolic script a year later it was called speedwords it was changed in and it has two uses to be a language and to be used for writing quickly dutton hoped that this would mean more people would learn it because they could use it for two reasons the books that dutton wrote about speedwords are not printed anymore but speedwords is now being used by more people because they find it is good for working online for example it makes it faster to type an email another way of writing quickly is pitman s shorthand this uses special symbols instead of letters speedwords uses roman letters this makes it easier to learn it also means it can be typed using a normal keyboard each word means only one thing this means you do not need to use different forms of the same word the words used in speedwords are the same as the words used in many other languages the words are like short versions of the writer s own language other websites overview of speedwords by richard k harrison horns and a tail in some religions the devil is a bad spirit or supernatural being that tries to create problems for people and distance them from god some people also use the words the devil or satan for the most powerful devil the word devil comes from the greek word diabolos which means someone who tells lies to hurt you diabolos is translated to the english word slanderer the new testament uses diabolos as a title for satan and so the devil became another name for satan in english in the old testament there is the serpent and the shaitan who may be two different characters shaitan in hebrew means adversary an enemy or opponent shaitan is also the word used for the devil in the koran who often appears as an animal and tries to get people to do the wrong thing in christianity the devil was originally an angel in heaven called lucifer but he refused to love the humans as much as his father god as he was instructed and so he revolted against heaven after a hard fight he was defeated and thrown out of heaven some other angels who helped him were also thrown out after the devil was thrown out of heaven he started doing bad things on the earth he wants people to worship him instead of god sometimes he tries to trick people by giving them false promises the other angels who were thrown out of heaven became evil spirits called demons they obey the devil and help him do evil things the book of revelation says that god will punish the devil and his demons by throwing them into a lake of fire that burns in hell this will happen in the future artists draw pictures of the devil that show him as ugly and evil but nobody knows what he may look like usually he is a spirit that nobody can see but he can make himself look like a real person in order to trick people many modern depictions of the devil portray him as a red human like being with horns and a pointed tail carrying a red pitchfork or trident not all religions believe in the devil for example some forms of buddhism do not believe in the devil many satanists believe in the devil or satan only as a metaphor not an actual being or person references diarrhea die uh ree uh also spelled diarrhoea happens when the body makes more watery feces than normal diarrhea can occur in humans as well as most other mammals causes diarrhea is not a disease but it may be a symptom of a disease the most common causes of diarrhea are viruses like norovirus the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis stomach flu in humans bacteria like e coli or c diff some medicines especially antibiotics food poisoning lactose intolerance artificial sweeteners like sorbitol and mannitol which are in many sugar free food products like sugarless gum other problems with the intestines like crohn s disease and irritable bowel syndrome child death in developing nations diarrheal diseases are the second most common cause of death in children under age every year in the world diarrhea kills around children under age in developing countries diarrhea is also one of the most common causes of malnutrition in children under age when children die from diarrhea the cause is often dehydration losing too much water from the body because diarrhea is watery it takes away a lot of the water it also takes away electrolytes important salts that the body needs to survive dehydration is extra dangerous for small children because they have less water in their bodies to begin with this means they cannot lose as much water as adults before they start to have serious health problems causes in developing countries diarrhea is usually caused by an infection in the intestines these infections can be caused by bacteria viruses or parasites these infections spread easily in some developing countries because of the following reasons unsafe drinking water bacteria viruses and parasites often get into the water which people then have to drink anyone who drinks the water can then get an infection that causes diarrhea sanitation with clean toilets is often not available this makes it easier for infections to spread clean water and soap for washing hands are often not available either if people cannot wash their hands bacteria viruses or parasites can stay on their hands these microbes can then enter the mouth or get spread to other people with handshaking preventing child deaths child deaths from diarrhea can be prevented in different ways re hydration when a child is sick with diarrhea the best way to keep them from dying is to rehydrate them give them the water and electrolytes salts they are losing by having diarrhea if the child can go to a clinic or hospital this can be done by giving water and salts intravenously through a needle placed into a vein if the child cannot go to a clinic or hospital oral rehydration solution can be used oral means given by mouth a solution is a mixture oral rehydration solution is a mixture of the most important things the body loses when it is dehydrated these things are clean water salt and sugar some oral rehydration solutions have extra electrolytes like potassium in them also some oral rehydration solutions come in packets and just need to be mixed with clean water oral rehydration solution can also be made at home if the water in the area is not safe it can be boiled to make it safe boiling the water will kill any bacteria viruses or parasites in the water salt and sugar are then mixed into the water drinking this mixture after the water cools will re hydrate the child if he drinks enough adding a banana or orange juice can add potassium to the mixture breast milk will also re hydrate a child with diarrhea preventing diarrhea there are some ways to prevent diarrhea or the spread of diseases that cause diarrhea however some of these ways are expensive and difficult to do these include making drinking water safe making sanitation better making clean water and soap available for hand washing related pages feces references square the cube and the tesseract the square is a dimensional object the cube is a dimensional object and the tesseract is a dimensional object a dimensional object is just a line a projection of the cube is given since it is viewed on a two dimensional screen the same applies to the tesseract which additionally can only be shown as a projection even in three dimensional space a diagram of the first four spatial dimensions dimensions are the way we see measure and experience our world by using up and down right to left back to front hot and cold how heavy and how long as well as more advanced concepts from mathematics and physics one way to define a dimension is to look at the degrees of freedom or the way an object can move in a specific space there are different concepts or ways where the term dimension is used and there are also different definitions there is no definition that can satisfy all concepts in a vector space a vector is an opened ended line a dimension is equal to the cardinality or number of directions of vectors or lines it is also equal to the number of the largest group of straight line directions of that space normal objects in everyday life are specified by three dimensions which are usually called length width and depth mathematicians call this concept euclidean space dimensions can be used to measure position too the distance to a position from a starting place can be measured in the length width and height directions these distances are a measure of the position sometimes a fourth d dimension time is used to show the position of an event in time and space other dimensions in modern science people use other dimensions dimensions like temperature and weight can be used to show the position of something in less simple spaces scientist study those dimension with dimensional analysis mathematicians also use dimensions in mathematics dimensions are more general dimensions in mathematics might not measure things in the world the rules for doing arithmetic with dimensions in mathematics might be different than usual arithmetic rules dimensions and vectors vectors are used to show distances and directions vectors are often used in engineering and science and sometimes in mathematics a vector is a list of numbers there is one number for each dimension there are arithmetic rules for vectors for example if jane wants to know the position of sally sally can give jane a vector to show the position if jane and sally are in the world there are three dimensions therefore sally gives jane a list of three numbers to show her position the three numbers in the vector sally gives jane might be sally s distance north of jane sally s distance east of jane sally s height above jane distance is how far one thing is from another thing distance is a measure of the space between two things it can be measured along any path thus someone who goes around in a circle has traveled a distance even though his position has not changed distance is a scalar thus different from displacement displacement is a vector that measures distance with a straight line and in only one path displacement is the shortest way to travel the distance examples one ball is feet from another ball the distance between the two balls is feet john walks at a speed of kilometres per hour for one hour john walks a distance of kilometres a circle is a curved line each point on the circle is the same distance from the centre of the circle depth in mathematics in math the distance between the nearest end and farthest end of an object is its depth for example jane measures a box when she measures the distance between the end of the box closest to her and the end of the box farthest away jane measures the box s depth see volume geometry width height length depth in liquids for liquids the distance between the top or surface of the liquid and the bottom of the liquid is the liquid s depth for example water is a liquid if you fill a container with water the distance between the top of the water and the bottom of the container is the water s depth if the depth is big we say the water is deep dictionaries a dictionary is a book which explains the meanings of words or more precisely lexemes the words are arranged in alphabetical order so that they can be found quickly the word dictionary comes from the latin dictio saying there are several types of dictionaries dictionaries which explain words and how they are used dictionaries which translate words from one language to another dictionaries of biography which tell about famous people technical dictionaries which explain the meanings of technical words or words connected to a particular subject sometimes called a thesaurus some of these come close to being an encyclopedia but an encyclopedia gives a lot of extra information about things knowledge and does not explain the use of the language an encyclopedic dictionary gives less information about the topic than a real encyclopedia does but more than a simple dictionary dictionaries which explain the meaning of words dictionaries which explain what words mean will give a clear definition of the word e g hippopotamus a hoofed mammal with thick skin large mouth and short legs that lives in rivers and lakes of africa a big dictionary will also give more information about the word it will explain how it is pronounced usually the international phonetic alphabet is used for this it will explain how the word is used this is not a problem for a word like hippopotamus but a word like put has so many different meanings that a large dictionary may have a whole page or more to explain how it can be used it will also explain the origin of the word e g greek hippos horse and potamus river a dictionary may also give the form of the word in different tenses plural form etc dictionaries which translate into foreign languages there are also dictionaries which translate words into foreign languages very often one volume one book will translate both ways for example half the book might be translating from english to dutch and the other half from dutch to english when using a dictionary to find out how to say something in another language one has to be careful to choose the right word a word like right has two basic meanings in english correct and the opposite of left other languages have different words for these different meanings but they have homonyms of their own a word like put has many meanings a good dictionary will have a large list of these meanings to help people find the word they want in many languages for example the word put will be different according to whether something is being put onto something e g a table or into something e g a cupboard updating dictionaries dictionary dictionaries need to be updated frequently because of the way language changes new words are often brought into a language e g lots of computer terms or words change their meanings e g gay or cool the most famous english dictionary is the oxford english dictionary or oed

bridge to sweden was expensive took a long time to build and required much planning by engineers there are still many islands with no bridges to the mainland people have to go by boat or airplane to reach these islands many islands will never be reached by bridges because they are too small or too far away if the island has too few people bridges are often not built because it is expensive to

used as a symbol for death death is the end of life in an organism all biological and living activity of the living thing stop including the mind and the senses the usual signal for death in humans and many other animals is that the heart stops beating and cannot be restarted this can be caused by many things all living things have a limited lifespan and all living things eventually die living things that have died are normally described as being dead death of humans is often investigated for the cause in case of crime such as murder accident or disease that may continue to kill other humans about people die every day around the world about two thirds of these people die because of age in addition to the physical body some believe humans also have a soul and believe that the soul can continue without a body afterlife move into another body reincarnation or cease to exist annihilationism religions have different beliefs about this issue many cultures have their own customs and rituals to respect the dead when people talk about things or events that lead to the death of a plant or animal those things or events are usually described as being deadly or fatal in the case of diseases they are described as terminal humans are no different from any other lifeform our bodies have an ability for self repair but that ability is limited finding the cause of death is a medical speciality called pathology in medicine death is when the heart stops beating for more than several minutes there are special times in which people recover even though the heart has stopped for minutes such as near drowning in very cold water if machines are used to help the heart and lungs work then the moment of death is more difficult to know society and culture mummified either naturally or by intention death is commonly a sad or unpleasant thing to people it can make people think about their own death people might miss or be sad for the person who has died they might also be sad for the family and friends of the person who has died in any society human death is surrounded by ritual a wake or funeral is normal in some places it was common to eat the dead in a form of ritual cannibalism but this is no longer common in part because disease like kuru can be passed this way human dead bodies are taboo in most societies and must be handled in special ways for a combination of religious and hygiene reasons a human dead body must always be reported in law to be sure it is disposed of properly dealing with dead bodies and their property finding the cause of any human death and stopping a similar death from happening to someone else are the main reasons people look into human morbidity or let dead bodies be cut open and looked at in an autopsy some religions do not allow autopsies because they feel the body is holy autopsies are usually required by the state if someone dies and people do not know why the autopsy helps find out if someone killed the person on purpose tried to hurt them or if they died from a sickness to prepare for their own death humans can write a last will and testament to be clear about who gets their property and possessions a person will sometimes also volunteer to be an organ donor this might mean giving the whole body to medical research it can also save the lives of others by making organ transplants possible religious views of death for a long time many people have been afraid of death and a lot of people have wondered about what may happen to people after they die this is one of the largest questions of philosophy and religion many people believe there is some form of afterlife ancient rulers sometimes did insist not only that their own bodies and much property but even their servants and relatives be destroyed at their funeral in india this ritual still does sometimes occur old women sometimes carry guns in case their husband s relatives come to throw them on the funeral fire christianity has a special focus on death because of the state killing of jesus christ by the romans in islam this is thought to demonstrate the injustice of human systems of dealing out death and the ability of the best people to overcome it and even forgive it in christianity itself it is thought to prove that jesus himself was really god and so could lose his body and still have the power of resurrection in buddhism reincarnation is believed to occur reincarnation is an idea taken from hinduism confucianism advises respect for parents and forms of ancestor worship to respect both dead and living ancestors rituals surrounding death every ethical tradition including the medical view of the body has some ritual surrounding death often these excuse behaviours that might be hated if they did not have the ritual for instance one may say that organ transplant is like cannibalism very much of what happens at a human death is ritual people who wish theirs to be dealt with a certain way and who wish a particular treatment like cremation of their body should decide in advance and set up the necessary payments and agreements this makes it much easier for their family after they die since there is no longer the ability to clearly communicate the wish for the same reason saying goodbye is important most of the stress of death seems to come for loved ones who did not have a chance to say goodbye maybe it is to relieve this stress that rituals are created and to bring together those that knew someone so that the personal experience a person can no longer communicate for themselves can be exchanged by others some ritual such as seances claim to allow people to speak to the dead this is not claimed to be very reliable both by scientists and even by those who do them very often preparing for death aside from wills goodbyes organ donations and funerals there is important personal experience to decide to pass on or not when someone knows they may soon die palliative care focuses on basic decisions people make when they are very close to the end of their lives and it ensures someone is always available to talk to them it is a replacement for heroic medical intervention that may keep them physically alive but with no quality of life human psychology must prepare for death if it is anything other than a quick surprise elizabeth kubler ross wrote that there were several stages in dying of which denial was the first and acceptance was the last recording one s life is often something people with acceptance will do to leave a memoir or a full autobiography because events leave living memory and may only be part of oral tradition there are projects to record everything that people remember about world war i and the shoah the first of these was to record everything remembered about the u s civil war this discipline has changed history since we have so many more first person accounts of the times and made social history much more standard other terms for death there are other terms for death examples are to pass away to go to a better place to buy the farm generally used in the military to leave the earth big sleep and to kick the bucket the term gone may also be a term for describing death for example if a person has died they are also said to be gone as in gone to a better place or no longer here unnatural causes of death old age is not the only thing that can end a person s life people make other people die this is called killing or murder three famous murders are john wilkes booth killing abraham lincoln james earl ray killing martin luther king jr and harvey lee oswald killing the president of the united states john f kennedy people can also die by accidents resulting in terminal trauma hypothermia starvation and dehydration causes of death old age natural causes severe haemorrhage cancer trauma starvation or dehydration disease references a diesel electric engine is a diesel generator a diesel engine that drives an electric generator the generator feeds electric power to an electric motor which turns a driveshaft its efficiency is higher than when an engine drives a shaft through gears most locomotives and many ships use diesel electric drive many diesel electric drives especially small ones store the electricity in a battery some designs also store braking energy in a flywheel which can also charge a battery however these add even more complexity and weight to the vehicle so are more appropriate for city driving where service stations are always available and there is much stop and go driving because they do not require any change or investment in stations nor much in vehicle design diesel electric vehicles are believed to be the most likely replacement for today s internal combustion engine when properly tuned they have low emissions and they use only about one third of the fossil fuel of most gasoline engines powering similar vehicles honda and toyota are presently delivering consumer priced diesel electric cars by contrast hydrogen infrastructure is thought to be decades off and is not fully implemented even in iceland where there is abundant free geothermal electricity in countries like india government is focusing on fully electric trains rather than diesel electric that too electricity will be produced by renewable sources like solar many activists feel that promoting hydrogen is a stall a way to avoid forcing the shift to diesel electric vehicles in the nearer term german embassy in riga a foreign embassy is the official office of one country in another it is usually in the capital

encyclopedias were printed until the late th century when some were on cd rom and the internet st century encyclopedias are mostly online by internet the largest encyclopedia in the english language is english wikipedia which has more than million articles the second largest is the encyclopdia britannica which is the largest one that is printed some languages have a larger printed encyclopedia and some have none either kind of encyclopedia can inform us on many different topics book series were used to summarize all knowledge have been published for thousands of years a famous early one was the natural history by pliny the elder the name encyclopedia is from the th century and meant complete knowledge the french encyclopdie of denis diderot was the first that had major parts written by many people from all around the world after the printing press was invented dictionaries with long definitions began to be called encyclopedias that were books that has articles or subjects for example a dictionary of science if it included essays or paragraphs it was thought of as an encyclopedia or knowledgeable book on the subject of science some encyclopedias then put essays on more than one subject in alphabetical order instead of grouping them together by subject the word encyclopedia was put in the title of some encyclopedias companies such as britannica were started for the purpose of publishing encyclopedias for sale to individuals and for public use in libraries like dictionaries which had definitions these publishers hired hundreds of experts to write articles and read and choose articles some internet encyclopedias allowed their paying customers to submit articles from other encyclopedias other internet encyclopedias accepted writing from non paying users users who did not sign in of the encyclopedia types of encyclopedias there are different types of encyclopedias some are general and have pages on lots of topics the english language encyclopdia britannica and german brockhaus are general encyclopedias some are about specific topics for example there are encyclopedias of medicine or philosophy others include the dictionary of national biography the dictionary of american naval fighting ships and black s law dictionary there are also encyclopedias that that cover many topics with one perspective or one cultural bias they include the great soviet encyclopedia and conservapedia there are two main ways of organizing printed encyclopedias from a to z the alphabetical way or by categories most encyclopedias go from a to z many

mantle earth science is an all embracing term for the sciences related to the planet earth earth science may also be called geoscience it is a broader term than geology because it includes aspects of planetary science which is part of astronomy the earth sciences include the study of the atmosphere oceans and biosphere as well as the solid earth typically earth scientists will use tools from physics chemistry biology chronology and mathematics to understand the earth and how it evolved to its current state if there is one fact which underlies all earth science it is this the earth is an ancient planet which has been changing the whole time since its formation the extent of the changes is much greater than people used to think fields of study the ordovician silurian boundary an example of marine transgression as exposed on the southern tip of the hovedya island norway due to the folding of the caledonian mountain range the layers have been inverted leaving ordovician granular limestone on top of the later silurian brownish mudstone the following disciplines are generally recognised as being within the geosciences geology describes the rocky parts of the earth s crust or lithosphere and its historic development major subdisciplines are mineralogy and petrology geochemistry geomorphology paleontology stratigraphy structural geology engineering geology and sedimentology smith gary a pun aurora how does the earth work pearson prentice hall nj geophysics and geodesy investigate the shape of the earth its reaction to forces and its magnetic and gravity fields geophysicists explore the earth s core and mantle as well as the tectonic and seismic activity of the lithosphere soil science covers the outermost layer of the earth s crust that is subject to soil formation processes or pedosphere oceanography and hydrology includes limnology describe the marine and freshwater domains of the watery parts of the earth or hydrosphere includes marine biology glaciology covers the icy parts of the earth or cryosphere atmospheric sciences cover the gaseous parts of the earth or atmosphere between the surface and the exosphere about km major subdisciplines are meteorology climatology atmospheric chemistry and physics astronomy includes the study of distant stars and galaxies to the examination of the billion years old earth from an astronomical point of view it is also closely related with the study of the solar system and its planets a subdiscipline called planetology a more distant relative of astronomy is physical cosmology which aims to study the universe as a whole closely related to the earth sciences are physical geography and biology list of earth science topics atmosphere atmospheric chemistry climatology meteorology paleoclimatology

geostatistics geodesy references earth is the planet we live on it is the third planet from the sun it is the only planet known to have life on it the earth formed around billion years ago it is one of four rocky planets on the inside of the solar system the other three are mercury venus and mars the large mass of the sun makes earth move around it just as the mass of earth makes the moon move around it earth also turns around in space so that different parts face the sun at different times earth goes around the sun once one year for every times it turns around one day earth is the only planet in our solar system that has a large amount of liquid water about of the surface of earth is covered by liquid or frozen water because of this people sometimes call it blue planet because of its water earth is home to millions of species of plants and animals the things that live on earth have changed its surface greatly for example early cyanobacteria changed the air and gave it oxygen the living part of earth s surface is called the biosphere orbit and turning earth turns at an angle an axial tilt in relation to its path around the sun earth is part of the eight planets and many thousands of small bodies that move around the sun as its solar system the solar system is moving through the orion arm of the milky way galaxy now and will be for about the next years earth is about away from the sun this distance is called an astronomical unit it moves on its orbit at an average speed of about earth turns all the way around about times in the time it takes for earth to go all the way around the sun to make up this extra bit of a day every year an additional day is used every four years this is named a leap year the moon goes around earth at an average distance of it is locked to earth so that it always has the same half facing earth the other half is called the dark side of the moon it takes about days for the moon to go all the way around earth but because earth is moving around the sun at the same time it takes about days for the moon to go from dark to bright to dark again this is where the word month came from even though most months now have or days history of earth earth and the other planets formed about billion years ago they were made of the leftover gas from the nebula that made the sun the moon may have been formed after a collision between the early earth and a smaller planet sometimes called theia scientists believe that parts of both planets broke off becoming by gravity the moon earth s water came from different places condensing water vapour and comets and asteroids hitting earth made the oceans within a billion years that is at about billion years ago the first life evolved in the archaean era some bacteria developed photosynthesis which lets plants make food from the sun s light and water this released a lot of oxygen which was first taken up by iron in solution eventually free oxygen got into the atmosphere or air making earth s surface suitable for aerobic life see great oxygenation event this oxygen also formed the ozone layer which protects earth s surface from bad ultraviolet radiation from the sun complex life on the surface of the land did not exist before the ozone layer earth s land and climate has been very different in the past about to million years ago almost all land was in one place this is called a supercontinent the earliest known supercontinent was called vaalbara much later there was a time the cryogenian when earth was almost entirely covered by thick ice sheets glaciers this is discussed as the snowball earth theory what it is made of rocky planets in the solar system mercury venus and mars earth is rocky it is the largest of the rocky planets moving around the sun by mass and by size it is much smaller than the gas giants such as jupiter chemical make up overall earth is made of iron oxygen silicon magnesium sulfur nickel calcium and aluminium the left over is made of many different kinds of other chemicals chemicals that are very uncommon such as gold and platinum can be very valuable the structure of earth changes from the inside to the outside the center of earth earth s core is mostly iron nickel sulfur and less than other things the earth s crust is largely oxygen oxygen is normally a gas but it can join with other chemicals to make compounds like water and rocks of rocks have oxygen in them the most common oxygen having rocks are silica made with silicon alumina made with aluminium rust made with iron lime made with calcium magnesia made with magnesium potash made with potassium and sodium oxide and there are others as well shape earth s shape is a spheroid not quite a sphere because it is slightly squashed on the top and bottom the shape is called an oblate spheroid as earth spins around itself the centrifugal force forces the equator out a little and pulls the poles in a little the equator around the middle of earth s surface is about long the highest mountain above sea level the well known mount everest which is above sea level is not actually the one that is the farthest away from the center of the earth instead the sleeping volcano mount chimborazo in ecuador is it is only above sea level but it is almost at the equator because of this mount chimborazo is from the center of the earth while mount everest is closer to it similarly the lowest point below sea level that we are conscious of is the challenger deep in the mariana trench in the pacific ocean it is about below sea level but again there are probably places at the bottom of the arctic ocean that are nearer to the center of the earth what it is like inside a picture of the inside of the earth showing the different levels in fact the air and the outside levels are much thinner than shown here the deepest hole ever dug is only about we know something about the inside of the earth though because we can learn things from earthquakes and the times when volcanoes erupt we are able to see how quickly the shock waves move through earth in different places the inside of earth is very different from the outside almost all of earth s liquid water is in the seas or close to the surface the surface also has a lot of oxygen which comes from plants small and simple kinds of life can live far under the surface but animals and plants only live on the surface or in the seas the rocks on the surface of earth earth s crust are well known they are thicker where there is land between thick under the seas they are sometimes only thick there are three groups of rocks that make up most of the earth s crust some rock is made when the hot liquid rock comes from inside the earth igneous rocks another type of rock is made when sediment is laid down usually under the sea sedimentary rocks and a third kind of rock is made when the other two are changed by very high temperature or pressure metamorphic rocks a very few rocks also fall out of the sky meteorites below the crust is warm and almost liquid rock that is always moving around the earth s mantle then there is a thin liquid layer of heated rock the outer core this is very hot the middle of the inside of the earth would be liquid as well but all the weight of the rock above it pushes it back into being solid this solid middle part the inner core is almost all iron this is what makes the earth magnetic pieces of the crust form plates picture showing the earth s largest and most important plates the earth s crust is solid but made of parts which move very slowly the thin level of hard rock on the outside of the earth rests on hot liquid material below it in the deeper mantle this liquid material moves because it gets heat from the hot center of the earth the slow movement of the plates is what causes earthquakes volcanoes and large groups of mountains on the earth there are three ways plates can come together two plates can move towards each other convergent plate edges this can form islands such as japan volcanoes and high mountain ranges such as the andes and himalayas two plates can move away from each other divergent plate edges this gives the warm liquid rock inside the earth a place to come out this makes special mountain ranges below the sea or large low lands like africa s great rift valley plates are able to move beside each other as well transform plate edges such as the san andreas fault this makes their edges crush against each other and makes many shocks as they move surface the outside of the earth is not even there are high places called mountains and high flat places called plateaus there are low places called valleys and canyons for the most part moving air and water from the sky and seas damages rocks in high places and breaks them into small pieces the air and water then move these pieces to lower places because of this the earth would have been very flat a long time before now the fundamental cause of the differences in the earth s surface is plate tectonics the shape of the entire planet itself is not even a ball because of its velocity earth has a slight bulge at the equator other than that earth is shaped more like a pear than an actual sphere all places on earth are made of or are on top of rocks the outside of the earth is usually not uncovered rock over of the earth is covered by seas full of salty water this salty water makes up about of all earth s water the fresh water people can drink is mostly ice only a very small amount is in rivers and under the earth for people to drink and use the air above the earth stops the water from going away into outer space also much of the land on earth is covered with plants or with what is left from earlier living things places with very little rain are dry wastes called deserts deserts usually have few living things but life is able to grow very quickly when these wastes have rainfall places with large amounts of rain may be large woods lately people have changed the environment of the earth a great deal air all around the earth is a large amount of air the atmosphere the mass of the earth pulls the gasses in the air down and does not let them go into outer space the air is mostly made of nitrogen about and oxygen about but there are a few other gasses as well most living things need the air or parts of the air gripped in the water to breathe and live they use the gasses especially oxygen and carbon dioxide to make and use sugar and to give themselves power the air animals and plants use to live is only the first level of the air around the earth the troposphere the day to day changes in this level of air are named weather the changes between places far away from each other and from year to year are named the climate rain and storms are both in this level both come about because this part of the air gets colder as it goes up cold air becomes thicker and falls and warm air becomes thinner and goes up the turning earth moves the air as well and air moves north and south because the middle of the earth generally gets more power from the sun and is warmer than the north and south points at the same time air over water specially very warm water gets water in it but because cold air is not able to take in as much water it starts to make clouds and rain as it gets colder the way water moves around in a circle like this is called the water cycle above this first level there are four other levels the air gets colder as it goes up in the first level in the second level the stratosphere the air gets warmer as it goes up this level has a special kind of oxygen called ozone the ozone in this air keeps living things safe from damaging rays from the sun the power from these rays is what makes this level warmer and warmer the middle level the mesosphere gets colder and colder with height the fourth level the thermosphere gets warmer and warmer and the last level the exosphere is almost outer space and has very little air at all it reaches about half the way to the moon the three outer levels have a lot of electric power moving through them this is called the ionosphere and is important for radio and other electric waves in the air it is also where the northern lights are even though air seems very light the weight of all of the air above the outside of the earth air pressure is important generally from sea level to the top of the outer level of the air a space of air one cm across has a mass of about kg and a space of air one sq in across has a weight of about lb the mass of the air also keeps the earth safe when rocks meteorites hit it from outer space without the air the damage meteorites do would be much greater because of the air meteorites generally burn up long before they get to the earth the air also keeps the earth warm specially the half turned away from the sun some gasses especially methane and carbon dioxide work like a blanket to keep things warm in the past the earth has been much warmer and much colder than it is now since people have grown used to the heat we have now though we do not want the earth to be too much warmer or colder most of the ways people create electric power use burning kinds of carbon especially coal oil and natural gas burning these creates new carbon dioxide and can cause more warming a large discussion is going on now about what people should do about the earth s latest warming which has gone on for about years so far this warming has been good for people plants have grown better and the weather has been better than when it was colder before some people who learn about science though say that many bad things will possibly come about if the warming goes on people the distribution of human world population in about seven billion people live on earth they live in about different lands called countries some for example russia are large with many large cities others for example vatican city are small the five countries with the most people are china india the united states indonesia and brazil about of people live in the north half of the world which has most of the land scientists think that people originally came from africa now of all people do not live in africa but in europe and asia people change the earth in many ways they have been able to grow plants for food and clothes for about ten thousand years when there was enough food they were able to build towns and cities near these places men and women were able to change rivers bring water to farms and stop floods rising water from coming over their land people found useful animals and bred them so they were easier to keep gallery related pages age of the earth earth phase geology list of planets solar system spaceship earth structure of the

see how well the idea matches the real world experiments have been used for many years to help people understand the world around them experiments are part of scientific method many experiments are controlled experiments or even blind experiments experiments can tell us if a theory is false or if something does not work they cannot tell us if a theory is true when einstein said that gravity could affect light it took a few years before astronomers could test it general relativity predicts that the path of light is bent in a gravitational field light passing a massive body is deflected towards that body this effect has been confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the sun now a hundred years or so after einstein published his ideas there have been many tests all of which have been consistent with einstein s predictions but one day we might find the theory has some limits beyond which it does not work what we test are implications of the theory because the theory itself is too large and complicated to test all at once the universe does not tell us when we are right only when we are wrong karl popper famous

generalized causal inference boston houghton mifflin ethics is the part of philosophy that deals with good and evil ethics tries to answer questions like what actions are good what actions are evil how can we tell the difference are good and evil the same how should we make hard decisions that might help or hurt other people how do our actions affect others ideas about ethics when discussing ethics the philosophy is generally separated into thinking about morality the involvement of science the freedom of people to decide for themselves how to act within their own beliefs morality is what someone thinks or feels is good or bad there are many different moralities but they share some things for example most people think that murder killing somebody is wrong compare exodus some philosophers have hope to find more things that moralities share they think that ethics should use the scientific method to study things that people think are good or bad their work can be used to test the fairness of a situation such as how people should treat each other an example of this kind of thinking is the categorical imperative many countries have laws based on this idea of fairness what is ethics used for understanding ethics can help people decide what to do when they have choices many philosophers think that doing anything or making any choice is a part of ethics ethics is part of other fields of study in many ways here are some ways ethics is part of the study of religion in religion people often learn what is good or bad from what they believe about god or gods some important ideas about what is good or bad have come from religion see ten commandments some theories of economics say ethics has to do with money money is a big part of most people s lives thinking about morality can be important in economics for example there is a saying about ethics taken from the bible that the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil timothy the philosophy of marxism also says that a few people using money in the wrong way can hurt many other people government policy can be affected by what politicians think is ethical politicians try to create laws that help everyone do what is right political debates happen when the people who make public policy do not agree about what is right in work thinking about ethics can help with hard questions work can be like both economics and politics workers have to make money and follow laws but the best way to do both is not always easy to know the study of this is called business ethics people like doctors and nurses have to make hard choices about how to care for people sometimes the person being cared for their family or the doctor do not agree what is best for them also choices have to be made if there are enough resources to help all the study of this is called medical ethics similar studies for specific professions include bioethics and legal ethics discussing ethics can also be a way to stop people fighting or starting a war by talking about ethics people hope to get what they want without being violent this works when all people agree that peace is very important but not everyone agrees about what is right or wrong so sometimes anger can make it hard to talk without fighting along with aesthetics ethics forms part of axiology the philosophy of what people like related pages conflict of interest utilitarianism the republic a book by plato that says that people who have power should use ethics to make choices the prince a book by niccol machiavelli that says that people who have power should not use ethics to make choices e prime it means english prime is a way of speaking english without using the verb to be in any way be is am are was were been and being instead an e prime speaker or writer uses different verbs like to become to remain and to equal or they might choose to rearrange the sentence to show that the thing does not actually act for example in e prime a writer would change the statement mistakes were made to joe made mistakes this change in wording reveals an actor joe where the previous form concealed the actor users of e prime would consider the changed sentence more accurate what e prime is d david bourland jr first suggested e prime in bourland had studied the discipline way of thinking of general semantics the main idea of general semantics is that people can only know what they observe and experience when they see hear touch taste smell think and feel and furthermore that what they observe and experience can affect how they observe and experience in the future because each person has different experiences throughout their lives they interpret their experiences differently students of general semantics and users of e prime contend that to say this cat is soft leaves out many other attributes and implies that the outside object of the cat is the same as the inside experience of softness instead e prime users say this cat feels soft to me to remind themselves of the following that their experience of softness involves both the outside object called cat and the eyes hands brain and nervous system of the observer that someone else might experience different aspects of the cat that they themselves might experience something different at a different time or in different circumstances the cat might scratch them or look or feel wet or matted with dirt what e prime is not although languages like russian arabic turkish and cantonese do not always use a separate verb for to be they do have the idea of being for example an english speaker might say this apple is red an arabic speaker might say this apple red most languages can be used to express the idea of a red apple an e prime user chooses to say this apple looks red to me to remind themselves that seeing red involves both the apple and the eye and brain of the person looking at the apple many teachers of english encourage students to use verbs other than to be to them using more active verbs makes writing clearer and more interesting these teachers want to improve their students writing and may not agree with the ideas of general semantics or e prime different functions of to be in english to be can have different functions it talks about identity the cat is my only pet the cat is garfield it talks about belonging to a class or a group the cat is an animal it can talk about properties the cat is furry it can be an auxiliary verb the cat is sleeping the cat is bitten by the dog it can talk about existence there is a cat it can talk about location the cat is here einstein on the beach is an opera written by the minimalist composer philip glass and theater director and designer robert wilson it was first acted for an audience in avignon france in it is a single act opera about five hours long with no intermission because of the length and the minimalist repetitive nature of the music audience members are free to enter and leave the opera as they wish glass s music tends to cycle round but does not exactly repeat itself admittedly he has described himself as a composer of music with repetitive structures though his earlier music fits what is normally called minimalist he has since evolved stylistically references were you looking for english wikipedia the full english wikipedia version of simple the word english can mean from or about the

a severe disease characterized by the sudden onset of hemorrhagic fever accompanied by other nonspecific signs and symptoms hemorrhagic means that the victim will bleed a lot inside and outside their body the virus attacks almost every organ and tissue of the human body resulting in multi organ dysfunction out of every people who get ebola on average five to nine die there are four kinds of ebola virus that can cause the disease the virus was first found in sudan it is found in africa with very few cases in europe and the united states transmission a d medical animation still of ebola virus a simple video explanation of ebola virus the ebola virus that makes people sick lives in the blood and other liquids and wet things in some kinds of non human animals without killing them scientists think the animals it lives in are mainly some kinds of monkeys or fruit bats when people touch animals that have the virus or wet things that came out of those animals they can get sick ebola cannot be caught through the air or by being near sick people the virus can only go from liquids into people s bodies this means ebola can be caught by touching a sick person s blood saliva mucus semen diarrhea vomit or other fluids that come out of a sick person s body if a person does not die from the disease he can still give other people the infection by having sex for nearly another two months after they stop being sick this is because the virus can still be in the man s semen after a long time once the virus enters the human body via mucosal surfaces abrasions or injuries in the skin or by direct parental transmission it fuses with the cells lining the respiratory tract eyes or body cavities it invades the macrophages and dendritic immune cells and releases its genetic content the cell explosion triggers the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines initiating a cytokine storm the genetic material takes over the cell machinery to replicate itself new copies of the virus are formed and released into the system the virus then goes on to attack spleen kidneys and even the brain the blood vessels leak blood and fluid into the surrounding tissues this atypical clotting and bleeding at the same time manifests externally in the form of rashes the virus causes the shutdown of other vital organs such as liver and lungs too in fact it is able to invade almost all human cells through different attachment mechanisms for each cell type except for lymphocytes the very cells that are meant to fight infection are used as carriers to spread infection to other body parts it has been found that the ebola infected cells do not undergo normal apoptosis but exhibit vacuolization and signs of necrosis symptoms when people get ebola the first symptoms look like some other diseases people get a fever and feel very tired their head stomach joints and throat might hurt sometimes people think they have other diseases like malaria or typhoid fever later people get much sicker they bleed both inside and outside their bodies they have blood in their diarrhea and vomit they bleed from their noses mouths and genitals sex organs they get shock low blood pressure fast pulse heart rate and low blood circulation to the body their organs might stop working ebola also causes stiffness throughout the body which makes it hard for sick people to move five to nine out of every ten people who get sick with ebola die treatment there is no cure for ebola but if people get care quickly from doctors and nurses at a hospital more of them live people with ebola need a lot of fluids to replace fluids lost from diarrhea vomiting and bleeding the most important care is giving them water with a very small amount of salt and sugar in it this is called oral rehydration it helps to replace their fluids and blood it is also important to give medicines in case they get bad blood pressure and blood circulation prevention in december a study found the vsv ebov vaccine to be very effective in the neighborhood of against the ebola virus making it the first vaccine against the disease many ebola vaccine candidates had been developed in the decade prior to but as of october none had yet been approved by the united states food and drug administration fda for use in humans research world community grid is a computing project that is seeking possible drug treatments people donate the spare time on their computers to the project reference ecology is the science that studies the biota living things the environment and their interactions it comes from the greek oikos house logos study ecology is the study of ecosystems ecosystems describe the web or network of relations among organisms at different scales of organization since ecology refers to any form of biodiversity ecologists research everything from tiny bacteria in nutrient recycling to the effects of tropical rain forests on the earth s atmosphere scientists who study these interactions are called ecologists terrestrial ecoregion and climate change research are two areas where ecologists now focus there are many practical applications of ecology in conservation biology wetland management natural resource management agriculture forestry fisheries city planning urban ecology community health economics and applied science it provides a framework for understanding and researching human social interaction ecology in politics ecology starts many powerful philosophical and political movements including the conservation movement wellness movement environmental movement and ecology movement we know today when these are combined with peace movements and the six principles they are called green movements in general these put ecosystem health first on a list of human moral and political priorities as the way to achieve better human health and social harmony and better economics people with these beliefs are called political ecologists some have organized into the green parties but there are actually political ecologists in most political parties they very often use arguments from ecology to advance policy especially forest policy and energy policy also ecology means that it is the branch of biology dealing with the relations and interactions between organisms and their environment including other organisms ecology includes economics many ecologists also deal with human economics lynn margulis says that economics studies how humans make a living while ecology studies how every other animal makes a living mike nickerson says that economy is three fifths of ecology since ecosystems create resources and dispose of waste which the economy assumes is done for free ecological economics and human development theory try to separate the economic questions from others but it is difficult many people think economics is just part of ecology now and that economics that ignores it is wrong natural capital is an example of one theory combining both ecology and anthropology sometimes ecology is compared to anthropology anthropology includes how our bodies and minds are affected by our environment while ecology includes how our environment is affected by our bodies and minds there is even a type of anthropology called ecological anthropology which studies how people interact with the environment antoine de saint exupery stated the earth teaches us more about ourselves than all the books because it resists us man discovers himself when he measures himself against the obstacle related pages environmentalism sustainable development references economists study how people make decisions such as those that occur in a alt a vegetable vendor in a marketplace so paulo s stock exchange buyers and sellers are not present themselves they use intermediaries and technology to trade most ideas about buying and selling are the same as in a real market though economics is the social science which studies economic activity how people make choices to get what they want it has been defined as the study of scarcity and choice and is basically about the choices people make it also studies what affects the production distribution and consumption of goods and services in an economy investment and income relate to economics the word comes from ancient greek and relates to okos house and nomos custom or law the models used in economics today were mostly started in the th century people took ideas from political economy and added to them because they wanted to use an empirical approach similar to the one used in the natural sciences subjects and objects in economics the subjects actors in economic study are households business companies the government the state and foreign countries households offer their factors of production to companies this includes work land capital things like machines and buildings and information in exchange for their factors of production households get income which they use to consume buy goods from other subjects business companies produce and sell goods and services and buy factors of production from households and from other companies the state or public sector includes institutions and organisations the state takes some of the earnings from the business companies and households and uses it to pay for public goods like streets or education to be available for everyone the last subject is foreign countries this includes all households business companies and state institutions which are not based in one s own country they demand and supply goods from abroad the objects things acted upon in economic study are consumer goods capital goods and factors of production consumer goods are classified as usage goods for example gasoline or toilet paper as purpose goods for example a house or bicycle and as services for example the work of a doctor or cleaning lady capital goods are goods which are necessary for producing other goods examples of these are buildings equipment and machines factors of production are work ground capital information and environment general economic rules all people have to decide between their options the cost of goods is what a person gives up for the goods when a person gives up something like money to get a good they also give up other things that they could have gotten instead this means that the true cost of something is what you give up to get it this includes money and the economic benefits utility that you didn t get because you can no longer buy something else this is called opportunity cost people choose between options based on the rewards incentives or bad things disincentives they expect from each option adding to the rewards for an option will often make more people choose it trade can make everyone better off markets are usually good for the organisation of economic life in the free market goods will be shared by people and companies making small decisions the invisible hand of the market adam smith states that if everyone tries to get what they want everyone will be as well off as they could possibly be sometimes prices do not fully show the cost or benefit to society for example air pollution is bad for society and education is good for society the government can put a tax or do something to reduce sales on items that are bad for society it can also support like giving money for items that are good for society the living standard of a country depends on the skills to produce services and goods productivity is the amount of the produced goods divided by total working hours when there is an increase in the total money supply or when the cost to produce things rises prices go up this is called inflation history th century analysis of wealth physiocracy classical economics marxist economics austrian economics neoclassical economics welfare economics the ideas that economists have depend a lot on the times they live in for example karl marx lived in a time when workers conditions were very poor and john maynard keynes lived through the great depression of the s today s economists can look back and understand why they made their judgments and try to make better ones branches of economics the two main branches of economics are microeconomics and macroeconomics macroeconomics is about the economy in general for example macroeconomists study things that make a country s wealth go up and things that make millions of people lose their jobs microeconomics is about smaller and more specific things such as how families and households spend their money and how businesses operate there are a number of other branches of economics behavioral economics business economics constitutional economics cultural economics development economics ecological economics economic geography environmental economics energy economics financial economics industrial economics information economics international economics labor economics managerial economics mathematical economics or econometrics resource economics urban economics public economics descriptive theoretical and policy economics monetary economics famous economists famous economists in history include adam smith his works include the wealth of nations and the theory of moral sentiments first introduce the concept of invisible hand thomas malthus author of an essay on the principle of population establish the theory of population david ricardo first introduce the theory of comparative advantage karl marx his works include das kapital and the communist manifesto a famous critique of capitalism john maynard keynes founder of the school of keynesian economics milton friedman proponent of monetarism his works include capitalism and freedom famous economists of the th and th century include friedrich august von hayek wassily leontief carl menger and lon walras related pages political economy constitutional economics references other websites economics citizendium sulphur has a crystalline structure bromine is one of only two elements that are liquid at c the other is mercury a chemical element is a substance that contains only one type of atom if a substance contains more than one type of atom it is a compound an element can be a solid liquid or gas the smallest particle of such an element is an atom atoms are made up of protons neutrons and electrons each element contains only one kind of atom the number of protons in an atom is called the atomic number for example all atoms with protons are of the chemical element carbon and all atoms with protons are of the element uranium the number of protons in the nucleus causes its electric charge this fixes the number of electrons in its normal unionized state the electrons in their atomic orbitals determine the atom s various chemical properties elements are the basic building blocks for all types of substances when they are combined with each other they can form molecules different chemical elements are known to modern chemistry of these elements can be found in nature and the others can only be made in laboratories the human body is made up of elements the last natural element discovered was uranium in the first man made element was technetium in chemical elements are commonly arranged in the periodic table where the elements are on the table tells us about their properties relative to the other elements chemical symbols chemical elements are also given a unique chemical symbol chemical symbols are used all over the world this means that no matter which language is spoken there is no confusion about what the symbol means chemical symbols of elements come from their english or latin names for example carbon has the chemical symbol c and sodium has chemical symbol na after the latin natrium tungsten is called w after its german name wolfram au is the symbol for gold and it comes from the latin word for gold aurum another symbol which comes from latin is ag this is the element silver and it comes from the latin argentum lead s symbol pb comes from the latin plumbum and the english word plumber derives from this as pipes used to be made out of lead some more recently discovered elements were named after famous people like einsteinium which was named after albert einstein compounds elements can join react to form pure compounds such as water salts oxides and organic compounds in many cases these compounds have a fixed composition and their own structure and properties the properties of the compound may be very different from the elements it is made from sodium is a metal that burns when put into water and chlorine is a poisonous gas when they react together they make sodium chloride salt which is harmless and edible mixtures some elements mix together in any proportion to form new structures such new structures are not compounds they are called mixtures or when the elements are metals alloys isotopes most elements in nature consist of atoms with different numbers of neutrons an isotope is a form of an element with a certain number of neutrons for example carbon has two stable naturally occurring isotopes carbon neutrons and carbon neutrons carbon neutrons is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of carbon of each element except for ununoctium at least two isotopes are known classification elements can be classified based on physical states at room temperature and pressure most elements are solids only are gases and are liquids elements can also be classified into metals and non metals there are many more metals than non metals however a few elements have properties in between those of metals and non metals these elements are called semimetals or metalloids related pages periodic table references egypt is a country in

defined as that which does not harvest more wood in a year than has grown in that year within a given patch of forest however the concept is also applicable to water and soil and any other aspect of an ecosystem which can be both harvested and renewed the so called renewable resources the carrying capacity of an ecosystem is reduced over time if more than the amount which is renewed refreshed or

they are actually choosing experiences or comprehensive outcomes of their choices for instance to buy local is to choose a whole experience of local suppliers such as in a farmers market or slow food that is quite different than the experience associated with factory food or fast food execution is where state authorities kill someone for having committed an extremely serious crime usually treason or especially terrible murders in most countries where the death penalty is still provided for by law using it is an option available to the sentencing judge even if the jury or judicial panel recommends the death penalty the presiding judge still has the option to lock the convicted person in a prison for the rest of their life beheading lady jane grey a probably innocent queen of england is beheaded beheading means cutting the convict s head off it is one of the oldest execution methods and already mentioned in the bible beheading used to be the standard method of execution in scandinavia and germany commoners were usually beheaded with an axe and noblemen with a sword a special device like guillotine can also be used as in france nazi germany used guillotine to execute criminal convicts such as murderers centuries ago many countries used beheading as an execution for important people including england in england many noblemen and even some kings and queens have been beheaded there the prisoner would be led up the scaffold and usually say a speech then he she would be blindfolded and put his her neck onto a block then the executioner would lift up his axe and swing it down onto the victim s neck if the executioner was skilled and the axe was sharp then the axe would usually cut through the bone and organs of the victim in one stroke but if the executioner was inexperienced then it may take many strokes before the head would be cut off other ways of execution the execution of emperor maximilan of mexico is a painting by edouard manet it shows a firing squad many countries do not allow executions as punishment any more because it is too violent however many states of the united states and some other foreign countries allow it even in the united states less violent ways of execution have had to be used here are some other ways of execution other than hanging lethal injection killing a person by placing several poisons in their blood this is used as the choice of execution in most u s states that allow executions gas chamber a person is placed in area where the air is filled with bad gases until he cannot breathe and dies this method was used for executions in some u s states and for mass murder by the nazis during the holocaust electrocution killing a person by placing them in an electric chair and giving them a very high electric shock firing squad several people shoot and kill a person armies around the world have long used this method since guns and bullets are readily available firing squad was the lawful means of execution in finland until when death penalty was abolished stopped by the law it was also used in the state of utah in the th century in most cases not all the shooters have real bullets after the execution it is not possible to determine which of the people firing killed the person just executed old fashioned methods garroting a method of strangulation used in spain for hundreds of years crushing also called pressing used in the common law legal systems a defendant who refused to plead stood mute would be subjected to having heavier and heavier stones placed upon his or her chest until a plea was entered or the person suffocated hanging using a rope to either break the convict s neck or to choke strangulate him widely used around the world until the th century still today in use in some countries such as iraq singapore and japan drawing and quartering a very violent form of execution common in medieval and renaissance europe it involved taking a person s organs out while he was still alive then tying him to four horses going in different directions until his body is torn apart a similar thing is breaking on the wheel when a wheel rather than horses is used to tear a person s body apart cruxifixion this method means nailing the convict on a cross it is considered as the most painful and nasty method of all it was used by the romans to punish traitors rebels and runaway slaves death by this method may take days the convict dies from blood loss slow choking loss of water and fever caused by muscle cramps besides the roman and persian empires this method was also used in

had days this was to make the calendar match the rest of the world in and february had days in the soviet union because the government changed all the months to be days long this year february days in it the name comes either from the roman god februus or else from februa the festivals of purification celebrated in rome every fifteenth of this month february begins on the same day of the week as march and november in common years and august in leap years february always ends on the same day of the week as october and additionally january in common years the month chocolates for valentine s day february february is one of the last two months to be added to the calendar at the beginning of the year the other is january this is because in the original roman calendar the two months of winter when not much would happen in agriculture did not have names february is the second month of the year coming between january and march and is also the shortest month with days in a common year and days in a leap year february begins on the same day of the week as march and november in common years and on the same day of the week as august in leap years february ends on the same day of the week as january in common years and october every year as each other s last days are exactly weeks days and weeks days apart respectively in a leap year february is the only month to begin and end on the same day of the week every year february starts on the same day of the week as june of the previous year as each other s first days are exactly weeks days apart in common years february finishes on the same day of the week as may of the previous year and in leap years august and november of the previous year in common years immediately before other common years february starts on the same day of the week as august of the following year and in leap years and years immediately before that may of the following year in years immediately before common years february finishes on the same day of the week as july of the following year and in years immediately before leap years april and december of the following year february is also the only month of the calendar that once every six years and twice every years consecutively either back into the past or forward into the future will have four full day weeks in countries that start their week on a monday it occurs as part of a common year starting on friday in which february st is a monday and the th is a sunday this was observed in and can be traced back years to years back to years back to years back to and years back to and will be observed in in countries that start their week on a sunday it occurs in a common year starting on thursday with the next occurrence in and previous occurrences in years earlier than years earlier than

capital it is things that have value but do not do anything by themselves they are only valuable because people value want them for example money is a form of financial capital you cannot do anything with money but it still has value financial capital is used to pay for things this is because there is always more of it and people always want it this means that financial capital has a stable value and can be traded in most places and with most people some forms of financial capital such as stocks gold or bonds are not wanted by everybody however they can be traded with people for money or another type of financial capital because of this these forms of financial capital do not have a stable price this means that some people try to make a profit by buying and selling these types of financial capital in a market some things are treated as financial capital even though they do have a use for example some people buy and sell land but are not interested in doing anything with it some people think this sort of trade is bad because the land should be used and not just treated like money other types of capital such as social capital and human capital are rarely treated like financial capital this may be because they involve people treating useful capital like financial capital is called comodification in politics a common question is how often the government should use financial capital in particular should the government use financial capital to make a profit traditionally liberal politicians do not mind this kind of trading for profit but socialist or conservative politicians are against it lee smolin creator of the fecund universes theory fecund universes is a multiverse theory of lee smolin it relies on models of our universe and statistics from astrophysics but is more correctly a theory of cosmology in this theory collapsing stars or black holes are always creating new universes with slightly different laws of physics because these laws are only slightly different each is assumed to be like a mutation of the original universe as if each universe was a kind of single celled organism it would reproduce by splitting in some sense this theory relies on many models of our universe to model these mutated alternative universes the ones that smolin supposes are generated or spun off by black holes no human can ever be part of any of these other universes observations from astrophysics can only say if the black holes exist or are common and give some idea of how much the laws of physics can vary and still let the new universes produce new black holes smolin predicts that there would be many black holes in the universe humans can see since they are likely in a very late born universe by simple probability if there are many black holes that is evidence for his theory as this shows cosmology has a very different standard of evidence and burden of proof than is required for models of our universe only which humans using mathematics can observe and exchange knowledge on it is hard to separate science from religion on such questions it may be a simple matter of preference whether one wants to see one s universe as part of a system like biology or like mechanics clockwork smolin s theory is important mostly because it challenges the mechanistic paradigm even if it is wrong it raises the idea that living beings might have to see their universe as also living to be able to understand or care about it at all some compare smolin s theory to gaia philosophy which combines biology geology and ecology to explain the earth our planet as a living thing if both are right humans are on a living planet in a living universe this idea is very appealing which does not mean it is really right food different plants that are eaten different kinds of meat different kinds of foods burgers food is what people and animals eat to survive food usually comes from animals or plants it is eaten by living things to provide energy and nutrition food contains the nutrition that people and animals need to be healthy the consumption of food is enjoyable to humans it contains protein fat carbohydrates vitamins water and minerals liquids used for energy and nutrition are often called drinks if someone cannot afford food they go hungry food for humans is mostly made through farming or gardening it includes animal and vegetable sources some people refuse to eat food from animal origin like meat eggs and products with milk in them not eating meat is called vegetarianism not eating or using any animal products is called veganism basic foods consumed by humans plant source animal source fruit vegetables grains seeds legumes beans peas lentils etc herbs spices meat seafood eggs dairy products food produced by farmers or gardeners can be changed by industrial processes the food industry processed food usually contains several natural ingredients and food additives such as preservatives antioxidants emulsifiers flavor enhancers for example bread is processed food at home food is prepared in the kitchen by the cook the cook sometimes uses a cookbook examples of cooking utensils are pressure cookers pots and frying pans food can also be prepared and served in restaurants or refectory in particular for kids in school the utensils used may be a plate knife fork chopsticks spoon bowl or spork many people do not grow their own food they have to buy food that was grown by someone else people buy most of their food in shops or markets but some people still grow most or all of their own food people may buy food and take it home to cook it they may buy food that is ready to eat from a street vendor or a restaurant food related issues food shortage is still a big problem in the world today many people do not have enough money to buy the food that they need bad weather or other problems sometimes destroy the growing food in one part of the world when people do not have enough food we say that they are hungry if they do not eat enough food for a long time they will become sick and die from starvation in areas where many people do not have enough food we say that there is famine there food and water can make people sick if it is contaminated by microorganisms bad metals or chemicals if people do not eat the right foods they can become sick if people do not eat enough protein they get the disease called kwashiorkor if they do not eat enough vitamin b thiamine they get the disease called beriberi if they do not eat enough vitamin c they get the disease called scurvy if children do not eat enough vitamin d they get the disease called rickets if people eat too much food they can become overweight or obese this is also bad for people s health on the other hand eating too less food could cause malnutrition disease therefore people have to learn to balance the amount and nutrition of food to be suitable food in religions many cultures or religions have food taboos that means they have rules what people should not eat or how the food has to be prepared examples of religious food rules are the kashrut of judaism and the halal of islam that say that pig meat cannot be eaten in hinduism eating beef is not allowed some christians are vegetarian someone who does not eat meat because of their religious beliefs for example seventh day adventist church recommends vegetarianism references if someone is found guilty of a crime their punishment may be to pay a fine a certain amount of money in many countries fines can be ordered by police court judges and some government officers when agreeing to a contract with a business a customer may agree to certain rules if the customer breaks the rules then they agree to pay a fine for doing so for example when somebody hires a car and agrees to return it by friday they agree that if they do not return the car by friday they must pay a fine to the business to fry food is to cook it in hot butter or vegetable oil we can fry food in a small amount of butter or oil in a pan or in a lot of oil in a pot some restaurants also have large deep fryers to fry a lot of food at once blue shark carp fish come in many shapes and sizes this is a sea dragon kira a close relative of the seahorse they are camouflaged as floating seaweed dunkleosteus a giant armoured arthrodire of the later devonian up to metres long it lived in the inland seas of north america this is one of the first works of art a sculpture of a fish age about years fish plural fish or fishes are vertebrates which live in water and respire get oxygen with gills they lack limbs with digits fingers toes this is a definition which does not quite work some amphibia also live in water and have external gills but they are not fishes fish used to be a class of vertebrates now the term covers five classes of aquatic vertebrates jawless fish armoured fish cartilaginous fish ray finned fish lobe finned fish there are more fish than tetrapods land vertebrates there are over described species of fish fish are usually covered with scales they have two sets of paired fins and several unpaired fins most fish are cold blooded poikilotherm a fish takes in the oxygen from the water using gills there are many different kinds of fish they live in fresh water in lakes and rivers and in salt water in the ocean some fish are less than one centimeter long the largest fish is the whale shark which can be almost meters long and weigh tons most fish live in the water a group of fish called the lungfish have developed lungs because they live in rivers and pools which dry up in certain parts of the year they burrow into mud and aestivate until the water returns fish is a paraphyletic term in cladistics because it lacks a monophyletic group of descendants it does not include the land vertebrates or tetrapods which descended from fish fish or fishes though often used interchangeably these words have different meanings fish is used either as singular noun or to describe a group of specimens from a single species fishes describes a group of different species types of fish fish the oldest vertebrate group includes a huge range of types from the middle ordovician about million years ago to the present day these are the main groups agnatha the jawless fish cambrian to present day pteraspids the head shields anaspids gills opened as holes silurian to end devonian cephalaspids early jawless fish lampreys living ectoparasites osteostraci bony armoured jawless fish gnathostomata the jawed fish includes all types commonly called fish except the lamprey placoderms heavily armoured fish chondrichthyes cartilaginous fish sharks rays and skates acanthodii extinct spiny sharks osteichthyes bony fish actinopterygii the ray finned fish chondrostei sturgeons and some other early types neopterygii first seen in the later permian lighter and faster moving than previous groups holostei the gars and bowfins teleostei the most successful group triassic to present day sarcopterygii the lobe finned fish dipnoi the lungfish eight genera survive coelacanths two species survive they were probably a sister group to the tetrapods certain animals that have the word fish in their name are not really fish crayfish are crustaceans and jellyfish are cnidarians some animals look like fish but are not whales and dolphins are mammals for example anatomy the anatomy of lampanyctodes hectoris operculum gill cover lateral line dorsal fin fat fin caudal fin anal fin photophores pelvic fins paired pectoral fins paired bony and cartilagenous fish most kinds of fish have bones some kinds of fish such as sharks and rays do not have real bones their skeletons are made of cartilage and so they are known as cartilaginous fish fish scales all fish are covered with overlapping scales and each major group of fish has its own special type of scale teleosts modern fish have what are called leptoid scales these grow in concentric circles and overlap in a head to tail direction like roof tiles sharks and other chondrichthyes have placoid scales made of denticles like small versions of their teeth these also overlap in a head to tail direction producing a tough outer layer shark skin is available for purchase as shagreen a leather which as original is smooth in one direction and rough in the other direction it may be polished for use but is always rough in texture and resistant to slipping the scales are usually covered with a layer of slime which improves passage through the water and makes the fish more slippery to a predator freshwater fish of all fish live in freshwater there are also some important fish which breed in rivers and spend the rest of their life in the seas examples are salmon trout the sea lamprey and three spined stickleback some other fish are born in salt water but live most of their adult lives in fresh water for example the eels species like these change their physiology to cope with the amount of salt in the water swimming fish swim by exerting force against the surrounding water there are exceptions but this is usually done by the fish contracting muscles on either side of its body in order to generate waves of flexion that travel the length of the body from nose to tail generally getting larger as they go along most fishes generate thrust using lateral movements of their body tail fin caudal fin however there are also species which move mainly using their median and paired fins the latter group profits from the gained manoeuvrability that is needed when living in coral reefs for example but they can not swim as fast as fish using their bodies caudal fins muscle fish can swim slowly for many hours using red muscle fibres they also make short fast bursts using white muscle the two types of muscle have a fundamentally different physiology the red fibres are usually alongside a much greater number of white fibres the white fibres get their energy by converting the carbohydrate glycogen to lactate lactic acid this is anaerobic metabolism that is it does not need oxygen they are used for fast short bursts once the lactic acid builds up in the muscles they stop working and it takes time for the lactate to be removed and the glycogen replaced using their white fibres fish can reach speeds of lengths per second for short bursts swimming for long periods needs oxygen for the red fibres the oxygen supply has to be constant because these fibres only operate aerobically they are red because they have a rich blood supply and they contain myoglobin myoglobin transports the oxygen to the oxidising systems red muscle gets its energy by oxidising fat which weight for weight has twice as much energy as carbohydrate or protein using their red fibres fish can keep up a speed of lengths per second for long periods swimming in groups many fish swim in groups schools of fish can swim together for long distances and may be chased by predators which also swim in schools casual groups are called shoals body shape the shape of the body of a fish is important to its swimming this is because streamlined body shapes makes the water drag less here are some common fish shapes streamlining the rocket shape of this shark makes it an efficient swimmer it is fast over short distances the picture on the right shows a shark this shark s shape is called fusiform and it is an ovoid shape where both ends of the fish are pointy this is the best shape for going through water quickly fishes with fusiform shapes can chase prey and escape predators quickly many live in the open ocean and swim constantly like marlins swordfish and tuna ichthyosaurs porpoises dolphins killer whales all have similar shapes this is an example of convergent evolution eel like the long ribbon like shape of an eel s body shows another shape this enables them to hide in cracks springing out quickly to capture prey then returning quickly to their hiding spot flatfish an adult flounder has both eyes on the upper side of its body flatfish live on the bottom of the ocean or lake most use camouflage they change colors to match the ocean floor compressed fish with compressed shapes have flat vertical bodies with one eye on each side they swim upright and can be very thin they usually live in reefs where their flat bodies can slip in and out among the corals sponges and rocks keeping hidden from predators angelfish surgeonfish and butterflyfish are all compressed fish fish as food koi and goldfish have been kept in decorative ponds for centuries in china and japan some people eat fishes many kinds of fishes are eaten the fishes that people eat most include carp cod herring perch sardines sturgeon tilapia trout tuna and many others a person who buys and sells fishes for eating is called a fishmonger the word to fish is also used for the activity of catching fishes people catch fishes with small nets from the side of the water or from small boats or with big nets from big boats people can also catch fishes with fishing poles and fishhooks with bait this is often called angling anglers also different types of fishing lures because people are catching too many fishes for food or other uses there are less and less fishes in the sea this is a problem known as overfishing fish as pets selective breeding of carp made them into the domesticated koi in japan and goldfish in china this breeding began over years ago the chinese brought their goldfish indoors during the song dynasty they kept them in large ceramic vessels

wear footwear especially in hot places or when they are very active their feet can smell badly foot odour wearing footwear that is too big or small can be bad for the feet people who have foot leg and back problems can also get help from special shoes people have different traditions in different parts of the world for when to wear footwear for example in much of europe and canada people usually do not wear their shoes or boots in a home or visiting in the united states people often wear shoes inside a home in japan people do not wear shoes in homes and floors are often made of very soft materials too soft for shoes in cultures where people always wear shoes people sometimes think it is bad not to wear them not wearing shoes can be good for the feet especially for children s feet

and more herbs and creamy ingredients typical ingredients like roux and fish stock and techniques such as marinading and dishes such as ragout were invented carme was an expert ptissier pastry maker and this is still a mark of french cooking he developed basic sauces his mother sauces he had over a hundred sauces in his repertoire based on the half dozen mother sauces french cuisine was introduced in the th century by georges auguste escoffier he was a genius at organisation he worked out how to run large restaurants as in a big hotel or a palace how the staff should be organised how

the restaurants and cuisine at the savoy hotel and carlton hotel in london the htel ritz paris and some of the greatest cruise ships escoffier however left out much of the culinary character to be found in the regions of france gastro tourism and the guide michelin helped to acquaint people with the rich bourgeois and peasant cuisine of the french countryside in the th century gascon cuisine

ovary in botany a fruit is a plant structure that contains the plant s seeds to a botanist the word fruit is used only if it comes from the part of the flower which was an ovary it is an extra layer round the seeds which may or may not be fleshy however even in the field of botany there is no general agreement on how fruits should be classified many do have extra layers from other parts of the flower in general speech and especially in cooking fruits are a sweet product and many botanical fruits are known as vegetables this is how ordinary people use the words on this page we describe what botanists call a fruit the fleshy part of a fruit is called the mesocarp it is between the fruit s skin exocarp and the seeds the white part of an apple for example is the fleshy part of the apple usually when we eat a fruit we eat the fleshy part types of fruits grapes are berries berry if the entire fruit is fleshy except for maybe a thin skin we call the fruit a berry a berry might contain one seed or many grapes avocados and blueberries are berries they all have a thin skin but most of the fruit is fleshy strawberries however are actually not berries because the seeds are on the outside on a real berry the seed or seeds must be inside pepo a pepo pronounced pee po is a modified berry its skin is hard and thick and is usually called a rind pumpkins and watermelons for instance are pepos hesperidium citrus fruits are hesperidiums a hesperidium is another modified berry it has a leathery skin that is not as hard as the skin of a pepo all citrus fruit like oranges and lemon are hesperidiums pome pears have a core surrounded by flesh meaning pears are pomes a pome pohm is a fruit that has a core surrounded by fleshy tissue that we can eat the core is usually not eaten berries are different the seeds are inside the fleshy part not separated from it by a core apples and pears are pomes drupe the big hard pit in the middle of this peach has a seed inside it drupes are also called stone fruit a drupe is a fleshy fruit with a hard stone around the seed we usually call this stone the pit of the fruit peaches and olives are drupes actually the almond fruit is a drupe too though we eat the seed that is inside the pit of the almond fruit botanical fruits since fruits are produced from fertilised ovaries in flowers only flowering plants produce fruits fruits are an evolutionary invention which help seeds get dispersed by animals the botanical term includes many that are not fruits in the common sense of the term such as the vegetables squash pumpkins cucumbers tomato peas beans corn eggplant and sweet pepper and some spices such as allspice and chillies accessory fruits a strawberry fruit the seeds are each derived from a pistil of the flower an accessory fruit or false fruit pseudocarp is a fruit in which some of the flesh is derived not from the ovary but from some adjacent tissue a fig is a type of accessory fruit called a syconium pomes such as apples and pears are also accessory fruits the core is the true fruit non botanical fruits strictly speaking these are not botanical fruits any produced by non flowering plants like juniper berries which are the seed containing female cones of conifers fleshy fruit like growths that develop from other plant tissues like rhubarb area of agreement cranberries lingonberries blueberries red huckleberries these are fruits which you can buy in shops and which are also acceptable as botanical fruits berry fruits redcurrant gooseberry cranberry blueberry also but not commonly known as berry fruits are tomato avocado banana false berries blackberry strawberry raspberry they are aggregate fruits see below the yew berry is not a fruit at all because the yew is a conifer stone fruits or drupes plum cherry peach apricot olive citrus fruits like oranges grapefruits and tangerines aggregate fruits raspberries blackberries multiple fruits pineapples figs many fruits come from trees or bushes for plants fruits are a means of dispersal usually by animals when the fruit breaks apart the seeds can go into the ground and begin to grow most fruits we eat contain a lot of water and natural sugars and many are high in vitamin c they have a large amount of dietary fibre fruits are usually low in protein and fat content but avocados and some nuts are exceptions to this not only humans but our closest living relatives primates are keen fruit eaters so are many other groups of herbivorous mammals and many birds seedless fruits seedlessness is an important feature of some fruits of commerce commercial bananas pineapple and watermelons are examples of seedless fruits some citrus fruits especially oranges satsumas mandarin oranges and grapefruit are valued for their seedlessness seedless bananas and grapes are triploids and seedlessness results from the abortion of the embryonic plant which is produced by fertilisation the method requires normal pollination and fertilisation related pages list of fruit diospyros references a farm in melaka malaysia a farm is a piece of land used to grow crops and or raise animals people who grow these plants or raise these

the study of lands features inhabitants and phenomena usually this means of the earth and its natural processes natural events and people however it may sometimes include other planets its features are things like continents seas rivers and mountains its inhabitants are all the people and animals that live on it its phenomena are the things that happen like tides winds and earthquakes the word geography comes from the greek language it means to write and draw about the earth the first person to use the word was eratosthenes bc a person who is an expert in geography is a geographer a geographer tries to understand the world and the things that are in it how they started and how they have changed geography is divided into two main parts called physical geography and human geography physical geography studies the natural environment and human geography studies the human environment the human environmental studies would include things such as the population in a country how a country s economy is doing and more there is also environmental geography maps are a main tool of geography so geographers spend much time making and studying them making maps is called cartography and people who specialize in making maps are cartographers branches physical geography a tropical cyclone off brazil physical geography sometimes also called physiography is the natural science that covers the natural environment and the earth s surface a geographer studying physical geography may look at biogeography climatology landscape ecology geomorphology glaciology hydrology meteorology oceanography palaeogeography pedology human geography a crowd of people around a band human geography is the social science that covers the study of people and their communities cultures economies and

something that is important or valuable grammar is the study of words how they are used in sentences and how they change in different situations the ancient greeks used to call it grammatik tkhn the craft of letters it can have any of these meanings the study of a language how it works and everything about it this is background research on language the study of sentence structure rules and examples show how the language should be used this is a correct usage grammar as in a textbook or manual guide the system which people learn as they grow up this is the native speaker s grammar p p when we speak we use the native person s grammar or as near as we can when we write we try to write with correct grammar so speaking and writing a language each have their own style different languages all languages have their own grammar most european languages are rather similar english makes few changes to its word endings suffixes in the italic or romance languages such as french italian and spanish word endings carry a lot of meaning in english we have just a few plurals and possessives john s are the most common in our verbs we have dropped most endings except one i love you love but she love s that final s comes from the anglo saxon which had more suffixes verbs do have endings which show changes in tense walk ed walk ing word order is the other big difference romance languages normally put adjectives after the nouns to which they refer for example in english a person may say i like fast cars but in spanish it is me gustan los coches rpidos the order of the words has changed if just the words without the grammar are translated into english it would mean to me they please the cars fast this is because spanish and english have different rules about word order in german verbs often come near the end of sentences as die katze hat die nahrung gegessen whereas in english we usually put them between subject and object as the cat has eaten the food changing language written grammar changes slowly but spoken grammar is more fluid sentences which english speakers find normal today might have seemed strange years ago and they might not because many of our favourite sayings come from the authorized king james version of the bible and from shakespeare different people speak with grammar that differs from that of other people for example people who use the dialects called general american english and bbc english might say i didn t do anything while someone who speaks what is called african american vernacular english or aave might say i didn t do nothing london working class version i ain t done nuffink these are called double negatives and are found almost entirely in spoken english and seldom written these differences are called dialects the dialect a person uses is usually decided by where they live even though the dialects of english use different words or word order they still have grammar rules however when writing in american english grammar uses the rules of general american english when people talk about using proper english they usually mean using the grammar of general british english as described in standard reference works the models for spoken english in britain are often called received pronunciation or bbc english parts of speech grammar studies nouns pronouns verbs adjectives adverbs prepositions conjunctions sentences phrases clauses interjections nouns nouns are thing words like table and chair they are objects things you see in everyday life proper nouns are names of specific places people or other things like days of the week the name james is a proper noun as is wednesday and london nouns can also be abstract things such as suffering or happiness verbs verbs are words that describe actions ryan threw the ball state i am worried the basic verb form is called the infinitive the infinitive for existence is to be a famous example is the speech of hamlet to be or not to be that is the question variations of the infinitive create verb tenses past tense was present tense is future tense will shall adjectives adjectives describe nouns for example the pretty in pretty bicycle says that the bicycle is pretty in other words the pretty is describing the bicycle this can also happen with a place for example the tall in that s a tall building is describing the building syntax grammar

lake will drop and suddenly push up the water level on the opposite side of the lake a foot tall wave in chicago caused several deaths in ecological threats the great lakes are home to a variety of species of fish and other organisms in recent years overfishing caused a decline in lake trout the drop in lake trout increased the alewife population in response the government introduced salmon as a predator to decrease the alewife population this program was so successful that the salmon population rose rapidly and the states surrounding lake michigan promoted salmon snagging this has been made illegal in all of the great lakes states except for a limited season in illinois lake michigan is now being stocked with several species of fish however several invader species such as lampreys round goby and zebra mussels threaten the native fish populations invasive species accidentally introduced species are a big problem since the th century about species have invaded the great lakes ecosystem causing severe economic and ecological impacts according to the inland seas education association they deprive fish of food cause blooms of toxic algae and foul boats spawning areas and drinking water intakes on average a new invasive species enters the great lakes every eight months two important infestations in the great lakes are the zebra mussel first discovered in and the quagga mussel in these molluscs are efficient filter feeders they compete with native mussels and also reduce available food and spawning grounds for fish also the mussels hurt utility and manufacturing industries by clogging or blocking pipes the u s fish and wildlife service estimates that the economic impact of the zebra mussel will be about billion over the next decade because the quagga mussel is good at filtering plankton from the lake water sunlight reaches deeper into the lake this increases the growth of algae pollution chemicals from industrial plants run off the land into rivers and arrive in the lakes some of these chemicals are highly toxic such as mercury contaminated water from sewer overflows also reaches the lakes and beaches get closed because of the threat of pathogenic bacteria

hinduism brahma shiva and vishnu are the most important hindu gods this image shows brahma on a temple wall according to certain religions and mythologies god is the creator of the earth and of everything else hinduism says that there is one god who can come in many forms theists believe that god created everything that exists and has ever existed in most religions god is believed to be immortal cannot die and to have powers to control nature far beyond the powers of humans the belief that there is at least one god is usually called theism people who reject belief that any deities exist are called atheists agnostics think we cannot know for sure whether any deities exist but still might or might not believe at least one deity exists people who believe in a god but not in religion are called deists people who believe that the definition of god should be defined before taking a theological position are ignostic in some religions there are many gods this is called polytheism some polytheistic religions are hinduism shinto taoism and variants of buddhism that syncronised with traditional folk religions it came into contact with in other religions there is only one which is called monotheism some monotheistic religions are christianity judaism islam and sikhism in polytheism the word gods is usually written in lowercase letters god is usually written with an uppercase letter when only one god is believed to exist some polytheists also use uppercase when talking about their most important god does god exist many people have asked themselves if god exists philosophers theologians and others have tried to prove that it exists and others have tried to disprove the theory in philosophical terminology such arguments are about the epistemology of the ontology of god the debate exists mainly in philosophy as science does not address whether or not supernatural things exist there are many philosophical issues with the existence of god some definitions of god are not specific arguments for the existence of god typically include metaphysical empirical inductive and subjective types some theories are built around holes in evolutionary theory as well as order and complexity in the world arguments against the existence of god typically include empirical deductive and inductive arguments conclusions sometimes include god does not exist strong atheism god almost certainly does not exist de facto atheism no one knows whether god exists agnosticism god exists but this cannot be proven or disproven deism or theism and god exists and this can be proven theism there are many variations on these positions and sometimes different names for some of them for example the position god exists and this can be proven is sometimes called gnostic theism or strong theism names there are different names for god in different religions some examples are yahweh elohim in judaism and christianity allah in islam baha in bah faith and ahura mazda in zoroastrianism believing in god the percentage of people in european countries who said in that they believe there is a god countries with eastern orthodox i e greece romania etc or muslim turkey majorities tend to poll highest by the year approximately of the world s population were part of one of the three main abrahamic religions christian islam less than judaism with buddhism with hinduism with traditional chinese religion with various other religions and less than as non religious most of these religious beliefs involve god or gods god in the abrahamic religions abrahamic religions are very popular monotheistic ones well known abrahamic religions include judaism christianity and islam monotheistic means the people in these religions believe there is only one god the name of god is usually not allowed to be said in judaism but some jews today call him yhwh yahweh or jehovah muslims say the word allah which is the arabic word for god believers in the abrahamic religions except islamic believers believe that god has created human beings in his image but this idea is not easily understood by humankind one artistic idea is that of an wise elder man in use since the renaissance god in christianity the christian holy bible talks about god in different ways within christian canon the old testament talks about god the father whilst the new testament is about jesus or god the son many christians believe that jesus was god s incarnation on earth christians consider the holy spirit to be god as well the third person of god in the new testament there are three beings who are said to be god in different forms the father the son and the holy spirit also known as the holy ghost this is called the holy trinity although the word trinity is not in the bible the word used for god in chapter one of genesis is actually plural and the phrase in the name of the father son and holy spirit is used in the new testament e g matthew another word that christians believe has exactly the same meaning as trinity is the word godhead which is in the holy bible christians believe that god incarnated in a human body through the normal birth process normally growing up into a man named jesus or yeshua coming to earth specifically to give every person an opportunity of salvation from their own evil called sin the effect of personal evil far transcends the repercussions humans cause to one another in the world but affects one s relationship with god the father and that aspect of the self cannot be addressed through one s own self improvement efforts but requires god to intervene in order to set one right when jesus prayed and talked to god he called him father and taught others to do the same jesus also taught that one must be born again in order to receive god s spirit otherwise one remains separated from god acting merely from their own mind thus being vulnerable to deception by human philosophies or the many spiritual philosophies which do not come from god but from fallen angels which are within various false religions after a person consciously accepts the free gift of eternal life which jesus s sacrifice offers god comes to live in the individual as god lived in humankind before the fall god in eastern religions in hinduism there is only one god named brahman but brahman is said to have taken on many different incarnations some of these are rama krishna buddha shiva kali parvati and durga to many outsiders the worship of god s different incarnations is considered to be the worship of many gods however it is really only the worship of one god in different ways some hindus also believe that the spirit of god lives in everyone this idea is called advaita vedanta which is the hindu term for monism religions like buddhism and confucianism involve the worship of many gods or sometimes no gods at all in shinto there is not a single specific god as is in most religions but instead a wide variety of deities called kami they are the spirit and essence of all nature things both animate and inanimate even including rocks trees and poetry for example as shinto is a polytheistic religion it is usually believed that there are eight million kami yaoyorozu no kami in the japanese language the number eight million is normally used to mean infinity god in western philosophy philosophers can talk about god or god sometimes they talk about a specific god but other times they are just talking about the idea of god one of the earliest western philosophers to write about god in a monotheistic way was the greek aristotle who describes god as the supreme cause aristotle saw god as a being that makes everything happen but is not influenced by anything else there are also some philosophical problems with god one of them is called god paradox it is a question about whether an omnipotent god can make a mountain that is so heavy he cannot lift it related pages deity thomas aquinas immanuel kant references yrei japanese ghost from the hyakkai zukan ca a ghost is considered to be the spirit of a dead person scientists say that there are no real ghosts but many people believe that there

trying to fix the problem if the problem is fixed the ghost can leave the earth many people say they have seen or heard ghosts people who try to talk to ghosts as their job are called mediums there can be bad ghosts and there can also be good ones there have never been any ghosts that have actually hurt or killed people although people tell stories about it many people believe they have seen ghosts others believe they have felt ghosts near them often the ghost is said to appear as a feeling of cold and a light or a misty cloud but sometimes people say they have seen ghosts that look more like people sometimes ghosts are said to come in human form some ghosts might cause fear in the person who sees them by being seen suddenly some ghosts are said to be friendly and help people who have problems ghosts are said to form right after they die or even centuries later many people make up stories or urban legends many try to prove the existence of these paranormal creatures with special technology such as heat sensors they also make tv shows dedicated to proving the existence of ghosts they often investigate cases where a person has seen one or visit a place of sighting stories of ghosts can be found all over the world chinese philosopher confucius said respect ghosts and gods but keep away from them the most feared spirit in thailand is phi tai hong the ghost of a person who

a state or province within a country or a region governments make laws rules and regulations collect taxes and print money governments have systems of justice that list the acts or activities that are against the law and describe the punishments for breaking the law governments have a police force to make sure people follow the laws governments have diplomats who communicate with the governments of other countries by having meetings diplomats try to solve problems or disagreements between two countries which can help countries to avoid war make commercial agreements and exchange cultural or social experiences and knowledge governments have a military force such as an army that protects the country from terrorists and other major threats that attack or which can be used to attack and invade other countries the leader of a government and his or her advisors are called the administration types of governments plato listed five kinds of government in the republic democracy the most common type of government in the western world is called democracy in democracies people in a country can vote during elections for representatives or political parties that they prefer the people in democracies can elect representatives who will sit on legislatures such as the parliament or congress political parties are organizations of people with similar ideas about how a country or region should be governed different political parties have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems democracy is the government of the people by the people and for the people however many countries have forms of democracy which limit freedom of choice by the voters one of the most common ways is to limit which parties who can for parliament or limit the parties access to mass media such as television another way is to rig the voting system by removing votes from opposition voters and substituting votes for the party in power few countries are textbook democracies and the differences between them has been much studied monarchy a monarchy is a government ruled by a king or a queen who inherits their position from their family which is often called the royal family there are two types of monarchies absolute monarchies and constitutional monarchies in an absolute monarchy the ruler has no limits on their wishes or powers in a constitutional monarchy a ruler s powers are limited by a document called a constitution in modern times monarchies still exist in great britain and the commonwealth the netherlands spain japan saudi arabia and thailand along with several other countries a monarch may have one of several titles king or queen emperor or empress or emir aristocracy an aristocracy is a government run by the people of a ruling class usually people who come from wealthy families families with a particular set of values or people who come from a particular place a person who rules in an aristocracy is an aristocrat aristocracy is different from nobility in that nobility means that one bloodline would rule an aristocracy would mean that a few or many bloodlines would rule or that rulers be chosen in a different manner dictatorship under a dictatorship the government is run by one person who has all the power over the people in a country originally the roman republic made dictators to lead during time of war the roman dictators and greek tyrants were not always cruel or unkind but they did hold on to power all by themselves rather than sharing power with the people the roman dictators only held power for a short period of time in modern times a dictator s rule is not stopped by any laws constitutions or other social and political institutions and can last many years or even decades after world war ii many governments in latin america asia and africa were ruled by dictators examples of dictators include josef stalin adolf hitler augusto pinochet idi amin muammar al qaddafi and gamal abdul nasser the rules of these dictators continued from when they took power until when they died because they would not allow any other person or law to take power from them there is no evidence of a woman serving as a dictator in modern times oligarchy an oligarchy is a government ruled by a small group of powerful people these people may spread power equally or not equally an oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things an oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or passed down from father to son an oligarchy does not have one clear ruler but several powerful people some past examples of oligarchy are the former union of soviet socialist republics and apartheid south africa a fictional example is the dystopian society of oceania in the book nineteen eighty four some critics of representative democracy think of the united states as an oligarchy this view is shared by anarchists the history and the theory of government the simplest idea of government is those who rule over people and land this may be as small as a community or village or as big as a continent like australia and india the people who rule can allow others to own land it is a deed by government that gives this right in the way that laws describe some think they have the right to hold land without government permission this view is called libertarianism others think they can do without government this view is called anarchism almost every place on earth is connected to one and only one government places without government are where people follow traditions instead of government rules small border disputed areas and the continent of antarctica because almost no people live there for every other place on earth there is a government that claims sovereign control over it the word sovereign is old and means control by a king sovereign governments of villages cities counties and other communities are subordinate to the government of the state or province where they exist and then to that of the country it is from kings and feudalism that modern governments and nation states came the capital of a country for instance is where the king kept his assets from this we get the modern idea of capital in economics a government may regulate trade as well as to rule over land governments also control people and decide things about what morality to accept or punish in many countries there are strict rules about sexual intercourse and drugs which are part of law and offenders are punished for disobeying them tax is how government is paid for in most countries people who buy sell import invest own a house or land or earn money are made to pay some of the money to a government there are many theories of how to organize government better these are called theories of civics many people think leaders must be elected by some kind of democracy that way they can be replaced at election many governments are not a democracy but other forms in which only a few people have power there are many theories of how to run a government better and keep people from hurting each other these theories are part of politics related pages constitution

galaxy is taken from the greek word galaxia meaning milky a reference to our own galaxy the milky way gravity holds galaxies together against the general expansion of the universe in effect the expansion of the universe takes place between groups of galaxies not inside those groups gravity holds the galaxy together and the same applies to groups of galaxies such as our local group in the milky way the gravitation is produced by the matter and energy in a galaxy or group of galaxies everything in a galaxy moves around a centre of mass which is also an effect of gravity there are various types of galaxies elliptical spiral and lenticular galaxies which can all be with or without bars then there are irregular galaxies all galaxies exist inside the universe there are probably over billion x galaxies within the observable universe description there are galaxies of different sizes typical galaxies range from dwarfs with as few as ten million stars up to giants with a hundred trillion stars all orbiting the galaxy s center of mass galaxies may contain many multiple star systems star clusters and various interstellar clouds the sun is one of the stars in the milky way galaxy the solar system includes the earth and all the other objects that orbit the sun star clusters are not galaxies they are inside galaxies globular clusters are spherical shaped star clusters which are part of the outer halo of the milky way one of the largest and oldest known star clusters messier has several million stars packed closely together with a black hole at its centre the stars are too closely packed to get an accurate count but it certainly has more stars than some of the smaller galaxies within galaxy clusters galaxies move relative to other galaxies they can and do collide when this happens the stars generally move past each other but gas clouds and dust interact and can form a burst of new stars gravity pulls both galaxies into somewhat new shapes forming bars rings or tail like structures ngc a spiral galaxy in the constellation antila produces new stars at a rate of or stars per year many galaxies continue to form new generations of stars the milky way and all spiral shaped galaxies like it see right side image of ngc produce new stars at a rate of one or two stars per year this star formation happens in the vast interstellar clouds that account for about to of the mass of these galaxies globular star clusters on the other hand are not currently forming stars because this activity happened billions of years ago and then stopped once all of the gas and dust clouds were used up in the astronomical literature the word galaxy with a capital g is used for our galaxy the milky way the billions of other galaxies are written as galaxy with a lowercase g the term milky way first came out in the english language in a poem by chaucer when william herschel wrote his catalogue of deep sky objects he used the name spiral nebula for objects like the andromeda galaxy years later astronomers discovered that they are made of stars as the milky way is so the term nebula is now only used for diffuse structures within a galaxy types hubble sequence there are two main kinds of galaxies spiral galaxy and elliptical galaxy they are classified according to the hubble sequence spiral galaxy ngc is a barred spiral galaxy a spiral galaxy is a galaxy that has a spiral shape most of the galaxies in the universe observed by astronomers are spiral galaxies about they are divided into two barred spiral galaxy classified as sb unbarred spiral galaxy classified as sa ngc and ngc are examples of barred spiral galaxies whirlpool galaxy and messier are examples of unbarred spiral galaxies the identifying characteristics of a spiral galaxy are disk shaped rotating spiral arms and a bulge in the galactic core the spiral arms are where new hot stars are born bulge in the galactic core has old stars this feature is common to the most spiral galaxies elliptical galaxy eso g is an elliptical galaxy an elliptical galaxy is a galaxy that has a ellipsoid d of ellipse shape this type of galaxy are dominant in universe especially in galaxy clusters the shape range from circle ellipse and cigar shaped in hubble sequence this shape can be represented as class e circle shape e ellipse shape e cigar shaped elliptical galaxy can have a large range size the giant elliptical galaxy can be over a more million light year and the smallest know as dwarf elliptical galaxy are less than one tenth the size of milky way the size of an elliptical galaxy can be measured as an effective radius which defines the area from which half its light comes the mass of elliptical galaxy is also large a giant elliptical galaxy can have mass of many trillions of solar masses other kinds of galaxies lenticular galaxy ngc a lenticular galaxy is a galaxy seen in a disc shape determining the shape of a lenticular galaxy is difficult because the shape can be between spiral galaxy and elliptical galaxy the shape can be known by looking at the bulge of the galactic center if the bulge is very bright it is a spiral galaxy related pages list of

or solid d but mathematicians people who study math are able to study shapes that are d d d and so on squares circles and triangles are some of the simplest shapes in flat geometry cubes cylinders cones and spheres are simple shapes in solid geometry uses plane geometry can be used to measure the area and perimeter of a flat shape solid geometry can also measure a solid shape s volume and surface area geometry can be used to calculate the size and shape of many things for example geometry can help people find the surface area of a house so they can buy the right amount of paint the volume of a box to see if it is big enough to hold a liter of food the area of a farm so it can be divided into equal parts the distance around the edge of a pond to know how much fencing to buy origins geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics geometry began as the art of surveying of land so that it could be shared fairly between people the word geometry is from a greek word that means to measure the land it has grown from this to become one of the most important parts of mathematics the greek mathematician euclid wrote the first book about geometry a book called the elements non euclidean geometry plane and solid geometry as described by euclid in his textbook elements is called euclidean geometry this was simply called geometry for centuries in the th century mathematicians created several new kinds of geometry that changed the rules of euclidean geometry these and earlier kinds were called non euclidean not created by euclid for example hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry come from changing euclid s parallel postulate non euclidean geometry is more complicated than euclidean geometry but has many uses spherical geometry for example is used in astronomy and cartography examples geometry starts with a few simple ideas that are thought to be true called axioms such as a point is shown on paper by touching it with a pencil or pen without making any sideways movement we know where the point is but it has no size a straight line is the shortest distance between two points for example sophie pulls a piece of string from one point to another point a straight line between the two points will follow the path of the tight string a plane is a flat surface that does not stop in any direction for example imagine a wall that extends in all directions infinitely related pages topology an undirected graph graph theory is a field of mathematics about graphs a graph is an abstract representation of a number of points that are connected by lines each point is usually called a vertex more than one are called vertices and the lines are called edges graphs are a tool for modelling relationships they are used to find answers to a number of problems some of these questions are what is the best way for a mailman to get to all of the houses in the area in the least amount of time the points could represent street corners and lines could represent the houses along the street see chinese postman problem a salesman has to visit different customers but wants to keep the distance traveled as small as possible the problem is to find a way so they can do it this problem is known as travelling salesman problem and often abbreviated tsp it is among the hardest problems to solve if a commonly believed conjecture is true described as p np then an exact solution requires one to try all possible routes to find which is shortest how many colors would be needed to color a map if countries sharing a border are colored differently the points could represent the different areas and the lines could represent that two areas are neighboring look at the four color theorem can a sketch be drawn in one closed line the lines of the drawing are the lines of the graph and when two or more lines collide there is a point in the graph the task is now to find a way through the graph using each line one time look at seven bridges of knigsberg different kinds of graphs a directed graph graph theory has many aspects graphs can be directed or undirected an example of a directed graph would be the system of roads in a city some streets in the city are one way streets this means that on those parts there is only one direction to follow graphs can be weighted an example would be a road network with distances or with tolls for roads the nodes the circles in the schematic of a graph are called vertices the lines connecting the nodes are called edges there can be no line between two nodes there can be one line or there can be multiple lines history a visualization of the seven bridges of knigberg leonhard euler solved this problem in which led to the devlopment of topology and modern graph theory a graph is an abstract data structure it holds nodes that are usually related to each other a node is a dataset typically in the form of ordered pairs nodes are either connected or not connected to another node the relation between nodes is usually defined as an edge graphs are useful for their ability to associate nodes with other nodes there are a few representations of graphs in practice the knigsberg bridge problem on a city map the same problem but using a graph leonhard euler used to live in a town called knigsberg its name changed to kaliningrad in the town is on the river pregel there is an island in the river there are some bridges across the river euler wanted to walk around and use each of the bridges once he asked if he could do this in he published a scientific article where he showed that this was not possible today this problem is known as the seven bridges of knigsberg the article is seen as the first paper in the history of graph theory this article as well as the one written by vandermonde on the knight problem carried on with the analysis situs initiated by leibniz euler s formula was about the number of edges vertices and faces of a convex polyhedron was studied and generalized by cauchy and l huillier and is at the origin of topology the fusion of the ideas coming from mathematics with those coming from chemistry is at the origin of a part of the standard terminology of graph theory in particular the term graph was introduced by sylvester in an article published in in nature one of the most famous and productive problems of graph theory is the four color problem is it true that any map drawn in the plane may have its regions colored with four colors in such a way that any two regions having a common border have different colors graph theory in perspective graph theory is an important part of mathematics and computer science to many such problems exact solutions do exist many times however they are very hard to calculate therefore very often approximations are used there are two kinds of such approximations monte carlo algorithms and las vegas algorithms references herm is the smallest of the channel islands that is open to the public

refers to good body health it is dependent on genetic determinators and also on social economic and ecological factors that means one s genes are partly responsible for one s physical health but also other circumstances where you live how clean or polluted your water and the air around you is and also how good your social and medical system is it is also the result of regular exercise proper diet

aboriginal people and torres strait islanders they lived in all parts of australia their lives were simple they had very few needs they lived by hunting fishing and gathering aborigines invented tools like the boomerang and spear there is also evidence that the aboriginal people used farming methods tradition was very important in their lives their religion is called the dreamtime which has lots of stories about the creation of the world by spirits aboriginal art started at least years ago and there are lots of dreaming stories painted on walls and cut in rocks all around australia aboriginal music has songs about the dreamtime sometimes with special instruments like the didgeridoo in the first european dutch explorer willem janszoon visited the west luis vaez de torres sailed through the water between australia and papua new guinea later that year only after dirk hartog chanced upon the west coast in did other european vessels visit and map the coast after sixty more ships visited the coast enough was known for a map to be published in the land was dry because of not much rain some was a desert the explorers thought no crops could be grown and so it would be difficult for people to live there they decided there would be no economic reasons to stay in dutchman abel tasman working for the dutch east indies company reached tasmania which he called antony van diemenslandt he then called the continent he charted the north coast of on his second visit in new holland in william dampier became the first englishman to reach australia but in a british sailor captain james cook found the fertile east coast of australia he called it new south wales and claimed it for britain englishman matthew flinders published his map of the coast in calling it australia for the first time a name later formally adopted by the authorities colonial australia adelaide in south australia was founded as a free colony without convicts the parliament of victoria in melbourne the british decided to use the land visited by captain cook as a prison colony britain needed a place to send its convicts people who had been sent to jail for theft and other crimes because its gaols were full and it had just lost its american colonies in the american war of independence in the british first fleet of ships carrying about people arrived at botany bay sydney arthur phillip led them as the first governor of new south wales about convicts were brought to australia from until free immigrants began arriving in the s for the first few years they did not have much food and life was very hard but soon they began to farm and more people came sydney grew and new towns were started wool brought good money by many towns had been set up and people from the towns often visited sydney for additional economic resources soon people from sydney found other parts of australia george bass and matthew flinders sailed south to tasmania and a colony was started at hobart in hamilton hume and william hovell went south from sydney by land they found the murray river and good land in victoria thomas mitchell went inland and found more rivers in the first british military outpost was set up at king george sound in western australia the swan river colony was started in with townsites at fremantle and perth in a free settler colony was started in south australia where no convicts were ever sent queensland became a separate colony in as the towns and farms spread across australia the aboriginal people were pushed off their land some were killed and many died from illness and hunger soon australia s aborigines were outnumbered by europeans and many were made to live on reserves the goldrushes of new south wales and victoria started in leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold the population grew across south east australia and made great wealth and industry by the goldrushes had made some poor people very rich convict transportation ended in the s and s and more changes came the people in australia wanted to run their own country and self govern the first governments in the colonies were run by governors chosen by london soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy the new south wales legislative council was created in to advise the governor of new south wales but it was not chosen by voters william wentworth established the australian patriotic association australia s first political party in to demand democratic government for new south wales in the adelaide city council and the sydney city council were started and some people could vote for them but only men with a certain amount of money then australia s first parliamentary elections were held for the new south wales legislative council in again with some limits on who could vote the australian colonies government act allowed constitutions for new south wales victoria south australia and tasmania in elections for legislative councils were also held in the colonies of victoria south australia and tasmania in limited self government was granted by london to new south wales victoria south australia and tasmania a new secret ballot was introduced in victoria tasmania and south australia in allowing people to vote in private this system was copied around the world in the right to vote was given to all men over in south australia the other colonies soon followed women were given the vote in the parliament of south australia in and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections in catherine helen spence became the first female political candidate

understanding of tradition spain is a country in europe early history people have lived on the iberian peninsula for about years neanderthal man came about years ago modern humans first came about years thousands of years ago iberians and celts lived there and the phoenicians made a few cities there to get tin and silver to trade the roman empire controlled spain for three hundred years then people from eastern europe called visigoths fought for spain won it from the romans and controlled spain for over two hundred years lady of elche made by the iberians th century the visigoths converted from arian christianity to roman catholics the land was won after a war by muslims who were arab and berber roman catholics from europe eventually decided to fight to take spain from the muslims they fought wars for many hundreds of years some of which were crusades against other christians like the cathars these were very cruel wars in the year they took the last part of spain that had belonged to the moors boabdil the last moorish leader of granada gave the city to king ferdinand of aragon on january and christians now ruled all of spain before this several different kings had ruled different countries in what is now called spain two of these countries castile and aragon came together when the king of aragon ferdinand ii married the queen of castile isabella in the same year they decided to send christopher columbus to explore the atlantic ocean columbus found a land there that the people of europe did not yet know these were the islands of the caribbean sea late th century columbus and other sailors explored more and found that there were two continents there north america and south america spain sent many soldiers and businessmen to north and south america and they took over very large parts of those two continents owning this empire made spain very rich but when they conquered that empire they killed millions of the native americans who had lived there before spain owned this empire for more than three hundred years meanwhile at home the muslim manuscripts had been either burnt or spread to other countries jews had been expelled from spain the multicultural society was destroyed and so was the learning among the few things kept and respected in spain were in music harmony and stringed instruments and of course the buildings many of which became churches by adding crosses th and th centuries the spanish empire was the strongest in the world through most of the next two centuries thanks to gold from the americas this new gold made rulers and colonial governors rich meanwhile others savings became worth less due to inflation spain became a society of very rich and very poor some of the poorest went to the new colonies in the caribbean central america and south america mostly to find gold native american peoples were killed by diseases brought by the spaniards but most spaniards did not know this they found damaged and dying societies with people who had lost some of their most important leaders and thinkers the spaniards thought this meant they were inferior and used this as an excuse to enslave the natives millions of natives died mining gold for the spanish the spanish empire also at this time funded the spanish inquisition which tortured and killed anyone who disagreed with the roman catholic church the reformation which created protestant sects in europe was not allowed into spain it was kept out and as with jews or muslims its believers were killed the nobles of spain no longer had to fight anyone since the internal feuds were over no one could challenge their power in many ways it was held together as a reign of terror people who challenged them were often called heretics so that the inquisition could torture them and then nobles take the property for ordinary people on both sides of the atlantic ocean life got worse a few rulers got rich today we would say that these people were guilty of war crimes genocide and crimes against humanity many church people who had the power to speak out at that time did so and they said many of the same things as we would say today but none of this mattered much to the rulers the great satire don quixote was written about this time th century in the th century there was doubt over who should become king of spain this doubt led many of the kings of europe to fight to become king of spain this was called the war of the spanish succession france occupied spain for a long time this made spain very weak it also made spain lose its empire in north and south america all of the parts of that empire became their own countries or were taken over by other countries such as the united states of america th century there was not much peace in spain during the first part of the th century some spaniards tried to set up a government chosen by the people a democracy and they made the king of spain leave the country however in two different groups of spaniards went to war over whether the government should be a democracy or take orders from one person in those who wanted democracy were defeated and a dictator named francisco franco took over the government franco died in he had decided that spain should have a king again and he chose juan carlos the grandson of the king who had been forced to leave the country to be king but the king did not rule as a dictator instead he chose to set up a democracy also since franco s death spain appointed adolfo surez to became spain s first democratically elected prime minister now spain is a

some people study the human body they look at where it is different from or the same as other animals bodies these animals can be alive today or they can be extinct animals like other hominids hominids are primates that are close to humans neanderthals and homo erectus were hominids some people study how the human body works and lives in its environment some people study what people think about their body artists study how to draw or paint the human body fields of study many different fields of study look at the human biology is a field of science it studies living things it looks at how the human body works it studies how the human body came from evolution it studies how genetics makes the human body anatomy studies the parts of the body and how they work together ecology studies the environment including how humans affect it physical anthropology is a field of science it compares humans to other hominids it also studies all other hominid bodies they look at how humans and chimpanzees are the same or different psychology is a field of medicine it looks at how people think and feel the brain is part of the body how we think and feel comes from the brain so psychologists study the body they study how the brain lets us be who we are religion also talks about the body some religions see the body as where the soul lives some see the body as like a church this is because a church is where people worship god these people think god should be worshiped inside people some religions think the body is made from chakras that connect us to the universe medicine sees the body like a machine doctors want to fix problems with the body they study how to fix the problems called diseases various organ systems give the body the ability to live and do things the human body and other animals the human body is like other animals the skeleton muscles and other parts are very much like those of other primates our body is also like other mammals and somewhat like other vertebrates dna differences follow a similar pattern the human genome is closer to that of other primates than to other vertebrates and closest to chimpanzee references hydrogen is the chemical element with the symbol h and atomic number it has a standard atomic weight of meaning it is the lightest element in the periodic table hydrogen is the most common chemical element in the universe with of all baryonic mass being hydrogen stars are made up of mostly hydrogen hydrogen s most common isotope has one proton with one electron orbiting around it at standard temperature and pressure hydrogen has no colour smell taste is not toxic is a nonmetal and burns very easily when alone it usually binds with itself to make h hydrogen in nature in its pure form on earth hydrogen is usually a gas hydrogen is also one of the parts that make up a water molecule hydrogen is important because it is the fuel that powers the sun and other stars hydrogen makes up about of the entire universe hydrogen s symbol on the periodic table of elements is h pure hydrogen is normally made of two hydrogen atoms connected together scientists call these diatomic molecules hydrogen will have a chemical reaction when mixed with most other elements it has no color or smell pure hydrogen is very uncommon in the earth s atmosphere in nature it is usually in water hydrogen is also in all living things as a part of the organic compounds that living things are made of in addition hydrogen atoms can combine with carbon atoms to form hydrocarbons petroleum and other fossil fuels are made of these hydrocarbons and commonly used to create energy for human use hydrogen has two different isotopes called deuterium and tritium like regular hydrogen they both have only one proton and one electron but deuterium also has one neutron and tritium has two these other types of hydrogen are important in nuclear energy and organic chemistry reactions some other facts about hydrogen it is a gas at room temperature it acts like a metal when it is solid it is the lightest element in the universe it is the most common element in the universe it burns or explodes when it touches a flame glows purple when it is in plasma state history of hydrogen hydrogen was first separated in by robert boyle henry cavendish in identified it as a distinct element and discovered that burning it made water antoine lavoisier give hydrogen its name from the greek word for water pronounced heew dor and gennen meaning to generate as it forms water in a chemical reaction with oxygen uses of hydrogen the main uses are in the petroleum industry and in making ammonia by the haber process some is used elsewhere in the chemical industry a little of it is used as fuel for example in rockets for spacecraft most of the hydrogen that people use comes from a chemical reaction between natural gas and steam nuclear fusion nuclear fusion is a very powerful source of energy it relies on forcing atoms together to make helium and energy exactly as happens in a star like the sun or in a hydrogen bomb this needs a large amount of energy to get started and is not easy to do yet a big advantage over nuclear fission which is used in today s nuclear power stations is that it makes less nuclear waste and does not use a toxic and rare fuel like uranium more than million tons of hydrogen undergo fusion every second on the sun burning hydrogen the electrolysis of water easily breaks water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity burning hydrogen combines with oxygen molecules to make steam pure water vapor a fuel cell combines hydrogen with an oxygen molecule releasing an electron as electricity for these reasons many people believe hydrogen power will eventually replace other synthetic fuels hydrogen can also be used as fuel in a fuel cell or burned to make heat for steam turbines or internal combustion engines hydrogen can be created from many sources such as coal natural gas or electricity and therefore represents a valuable addition to the power grid in the same role as natural gas such a grid and infrastructure with fuel cell vehicles is now planned by a number of countries including japan korea and many european countries this allows these countries to buy less petroleum which is an economic advantage the other advantage is that used in a fuel cell or burned in a combustion engine as in a hydrogen car the motor does not make pollution only water and a small amount of nitrogen oxides forms references other websites hydrogen citizendium because it is very light helium is the gas of choice to fill airships such as the goodyear blimp helium is a chemical element it has the chemical symbol he atomic number and atomic weight of about there are isotopes of helium only two of which are stable these are he and he he is by far the most common isotope helium is called a noble gas because it does not regularly mix with other chemicals and form new compounds it has the lowest boiling point of all the elements it is the second most common element in the universe after hydrogen and has no color or smell however helium has a red orange glow when placed in an electric field helium does not usually react with anything else astronomers detected the presence of helium in when its spectrum was identified in light from the sun prior to its discovery on earth based on this location its name was derived from the greek word for sun helios helium is used to fill balloons and airships because it is lighter than air and does not burn or react meaning it is normally safe for using it in that way it is also used in some kinds of light bulbs people also breathe it in to make their voices sound higher than they normally do as a joke but this is extremely dangerous as if they breathe in too much it can kill them as they are not breathing normal air breathing too much helium can also cause long term effects to vocal cords it can be created through the process of nuclear fusion in the sun during this process four hydrogen atoms are fused together to form one helium atom supply helium has become a rare gas if it gets free into the air it leaves the planet unlike hydrogen which reacts with oxygen to form water helium is not reactive it stays as a gas for many years the usa kept a storage tank filled with helium which came naturally from the great plains area the story of this supply is very complicated at present more helium is supplied by qatar than by the usa several research organisations have released statements on the scarcity and conservation of helium these organisations released policy recommendations as early as and as late as urging the united states government to store and conserve helium because of the natural limits to the helium supply and the unique nature of the element for researchers helium is irreplaceable because it is essential for producing very low temperatures references the home page of a web site is the document

mammals animal hair is usually called fur sheep and goats have curly hair which is usually called wool hair is made of keratins which are proteins humans and some other animals have lost much of their hair through evolution and some other mammals such as the elephant and the whale have almost none at all functions of hair the male lion s mane has several functions hair can have different functions it can protect against losing body heat this is thought to be the basic original function of hair it protects against uv radiation which damages the skin it can protect against rain or water air can be trapped in the fur or oil can be secreted by the skin both these methods prevent the rain or water from making the body too cold aquatic mammals in cold waters usually have blubber fat under the skin and almost no hair defence hair is modified in mammals like porcupines for protection hair colouring can perform different functions it helps to camouflage in some animals and to signal to others of the same species in some other animals examples are signalling to females for mating purposes and signalling to others for territory control signalling danger to other species aposematic colouring is also done by for example skunks animals can change their hair so they look bigger or more threatening this can also be used for mating which is the case with lions for example also the male lions mane also protects their neck from damage when fighting other males false hair some animals for example certain insects and spiders also have hairs however these are not hair in the biological sense but are actually bristles the hairs found on certain plants are also not true hair but trichomes human hair a man with hair on his head face and body in humans hair grows mostly on the head and the amount of body hair is different from race to race asians and native north americans have the least amount of body hair while caucasians tend to have the most hair color different human hair colors from top to left clockwise black brown blonde white red hair color is passed down by parents only natural hair color can be given only by genes it is impossible to have a hair color that is not passed down genetically by both mother and father this relies on dominant and recessive genes carried by a parent these genes may not be the color of their hair however many people carry genes that are recessive and do not show in their traits or features dyeing hair is to change the color of hair it consists of a chemical mixture which can change the color of hair by a chemical reaction many people dye their hair to hide gray or white hairs this is because most people gain white or gray hairs as they grow older genetics and chemistry two types of melanin pigment give hair its color eumelanin and pheomelanin pheomelanin colors hair red eumelanin determines the darkness of the hair color a low concentration of brown eumelanin results in blond hair but more brown eumelanin will color the hair brown high amounts of black eumelanin result in black hair while low concentrations give gray hair all humans have some pheomelanin in their hair the genetics of hair colors are not yet firmly established according to one theory at least two gene pairs control human hair color one phenotype brown blond has a dominant brown allele and a recessive blond allele a person with a brown allele will have brown hair a person with no brown alleles will be blond this explains why two brown haired parents can produce a blond haired child the other gene pair is a non red red pair where the not red allele is dominant and the allele for red hair is recessive a person with two copies of the red haired allele will have red hair but it will be either auburn or bright reddish orange depending on whether the first gene pair gives brown or blond hair respectively the two gene model does not account for all possible shades of brown blond or red for example platinum blond versus dark blonde light brown nor does it explain why hair color sometimes darkens as a person ages several other gene pairs control the light versus dark hair color in a cumulative effect quantitative genetics hair texture hair texture is also inherited genetically the thickness of hair its color and its tendency to curl are all inherited there are also genetic differences between men and women body hair is limited in women and thicker in men hair loss people have about hairs on their head about fall out each day but they usually grow back some men are bald but girls and women may become bald if they lose their hair from a disease called alopecia men often lose some of their hair as they grow older this is known as baldness doctors call it male pattern baldness because hairs often fall out in similar places it often begins by hair falling out first from the front of the head and then from the top of the head after a while all that may be left is a some hair running above the ears and around the lower back of the head even though it is unusual for women to go bald many women suffer from thinning hair over the top of their head as they grow old people have tried to find cures for hair loss for thousands of years in an effort to get their hair back men have tried cures like applying strange lotions or even having their heads packed in chicken manure many unproven cures are still marketed today it is only in the last decade or so that treatments have been developed which do sometimes work some doctors do hair transplants where they take tiny plugs of hair from areas like the back of the neck and plant them in the bald spots on the head some drugs have been tested and approved for sale as hair loss treatments they encourage hair regrowth and thickening but work better if applied before hair loss turns to baldness history and culture a braided hairstyle a bold hair color and style people have been interested in hair on their heads for hundreds of thousands of years for both men and women styling and coloring hair have been ways to look good and get attention sometimes society makes rules about hair for example by not allowing people to cut their hair or beards like in

co waterford the anglo normans conquered many parts of ireland in the following years they introduced their way of life to the irish people the feudal system was soon introduced in ireland as a means of organising land castles were built to defend the land like trim castle co meath during the middle ages ireland s first proper towns were built from until all of ireland was part of the united

the republic of ireland act which declared it to be a republic migration many irish people have left ireland and moved to the united states canada australia and south america the great famine in the s forced many to leave it is estimated almost a million people died of starvation and a million more emigrated from a maximum of over million in the total irish population dropped to just over million

called arpanet the world wide web was created at cern in switzerland in by a british uk scientist named tim berners lee today people can pay money to access the internet from internet service providers some services on the internet cost nothing to use sometimes people who offer these free services use advertising to make money censorship and freedom of speech on the internet can be controversial services on the internet the internet is used for many things such as electronic mail online chat file transfer and the interlinked web pages and other documents of the world wide web the most used service on the internet is the world wide web which is also called the web or www the web contains websites including blogs and wikis like wikipedia webpages on the internet can be seen and read by anyone unless the page needs a password or it is blocked the second biggest use of the internet is to send and receive e mail e mail is private and goes from one user to another instant messaging such as aim or icq is similar to email but allows two or more people to chat to each other faster some governments think the internet is a bad thing and block all or part of it for example the chinese government thinks that wikipedia is bad many times no one in china can read it or add to it another example of the internet being blocked is in north korea some parents block parts of the internet they think are bad for children to see dangers on the internet the internet makes communication easy and communication can be dangerous too people often send secret information and sometimes other people can steal that information they can use the internet to spread lies or stolen secrets or dangerously bad advice for example facebook has had some problems with privacy settings a person can post information on the website but this is often a bad idea unless the person is very sure of what they are doing one way to check for a secure website is to make sure the url starts with instead of this means it is secured so other people cannot read information while it is being sent however it does not mean the website will do things to keep it safe some websites may trick people into downloading viruses that can harm a computer or spyware that spies on its users looks at what they are doing and tells someone else e mails can also have harmful files with them as attachments in internet chatrooms people might be preying on others or trying to stalk or abuse them the internet contains content that many people find offensive such as pornography as well as content intended to

understood because of their popular use because idioms can mean something different from what the words mean it is difficult for someone not very good at speaking the language to use them properly some idioms are only used by some groups of people or at certain times the idiom shape up or ship out which is like saying improve your behavior or leave if you don t might be said by an employer or supervisor to an employee but not to other people idioms are not the same thing as slang idioms are made of normal words that have a special meaning known to almost everyone slang is usually special words or special meanings of normal words that are known only to a particular group of people to learn a language a person needs to learn the words in that language and how and when to use them but people also need to learn idioms separately because certain words together or at certain times can have different meanings in order to understand an idiom one sometimes needs to know the culture the idiom comes from to know the history of an idiom can be useful and interesting but is not necessary to be able to use the idiom properly for example most native british english speakers know that no room to swing a cat means there was not much space and can use the idiom properly however few know this is because years ago sailors were punished by being whipped with a cat o nine tails a big space was cleared on the ship so that the person doing the whipping had room to swing the cat an idiom is a phrase whose meaning cannot be understood from the dictionary definitions of each word taken separately the linguist s term for the real meaning of an idiom is the subtext some common idioms break a leg a way to wish someone good luck to live it up to enjoy life to live widely to kick the bucket to die shape up or ship out used to tell someone that they should leave if they don t improve their behavior or performance to shed crocodile tears to cry about something but without actually caring wild goose chase a useless journey or pursuit there s no room to swing a cat there is not a lot of space to pay through the nose to pay a lot of money more than is normal to bark up the wrong

in english are unclear or ambiguous many are understood differently in different countries many of the examples are taken from face to face talk but may also apply in written reports examples satisfactory in a report or in an assessment might mean not satisfactory i hear what you say might mean i m listening but more likely i totally disagree with the greatest respect may mean you are quite wrong of british thought it meant i think you are an idiot whereas of americans thought it meant i am listening to you i ll bear it in mind in a survey of british thought it meant i ve forgotten it already of americans thought it meant i will probably do it there are some expressions which defy attempts to explain them yet they are quite common one is a long drawn out sound hmmmmmm one suggestion is that these idioms are used to smooth over difficult areas in social interaction they cover passive aggressive statements which might cause more conflict if openly expressed references

in or there are inches in a foot one inch is equal to centimetres the word inch came from middle english unche which came from old english ynce from latin uncia meaning a twelfth part history the inch was originally defined as barleycorns the inch was finally standardised in the international yard and pound treaty in between the united states the united kingdom south africa australia new zealand and canada the international yard was made equal to metres from this subdivisions and multiples of the yard were specifically defined usage in the united states people use inches more than they use millimetres or centimetres in the rest of the world international units are almost always used the inch is not used by scientists in the united kingdom road signs that show how high a vehicle can be in order to pass through a tunnel are required to be in feet and inches theme parks and drive thru signs usually show it in metres people regularly measure their height in feet and inches official medical records however are required to record people s height in metric measurements only in canada a mix of centimetres and inches are used in height older generations especially use imperial units a lot of exposure to americanized phrases leads to younger generations often having a good understanding of both the imperial and metric systems in the united states height is always in feet and

religions the indian religions are similar to one another in many ways the basic beliefs the way worship is done and several religious practices are very similar these similarities mainly come from the fact that these religions have a common history and common origins they also influenced each other the religion of hinduism is the main faith followed by of people in the republic of india islam christianity sikhism buddhism and jainism it s the first time ever since independence that hindu population percentage fell below technology india sent a spacecraft to mars for the first time in that

insult is a description of someone that will offend them it may or may not be true it is called derogatory language terms like foolish stupid idiot and moron are insults because they say that a person s mind is not quick or smart insulting someone s mother directly is a serious insult in many cultures ritual insults are part of many cultures for example they can be found in sports and military training they are also very common in jargons for example the word newbie is a part of net jargon calling someone a newbie is usually insulting one should be very careful when using new words to describe others reason usually someone insults others because they want to feel like they are better or have more power influence than the people they insult they may want this because they are actually afraid that they are worse or less powerful than the people they are insulting effects when someone is insulted his or her pride is hurt he or she may want to fight back by insulting the person who insulted him or her immunology is the study of the immune system the immune system is the parts of the body which work against infection and parasitism by other living things immunology deals with the working of the immune system in health and diseases and with malfunctions of the immune system an immune system is present in all plants and animals we know this because biologists have found genes coding for toll like receptors in many different metazoans these toll like receptors can recognise bacteria as foreign and are the starting point for immune reactions the type of immunity which is triggered by the toll like receptors is called innate immunity this is because it is entirely inherited in our genome and is fully working as soon as our tissues and organs are properly developed vertebrates and only vertebrates have a second type of immunity this is called adaptive immunity because it remembers previous infections then if the same infection occurs again the reaction is much stronger and faster this immunological memory confers a tremendous survival advantage and with it vertebrates can survive over a long lifetime in a pathogen filled environment types of immunity in vertebrates innate immune response the innate immune system is usually means all of the cells and systems that does not have to be exposed to a particular pathogen before they can work innate immunity starts with the skin which is an excellent barrier to infection adaptive immune response the adaptive immune system includes cells and systems that do require previous exposure to a pathogen it explains the unique ability of the mammalian immune system to remember previous infections and mount a rapid and robust reaction to secondary infections this immunological memory is due to the biology of t cells and b cells other aspects of immunity vaccines boost the acquired immune system by offering weak forms of infection that the body can fight off the system remembers how to do it again when a stronger infection happens if the vaccine works the body can then fight off a serious infection the distribution of vaccines and other immune system affecting cures can be considered another level of acquired immune system one governed by access to vaccination and medicine in general the intersection of this with the spread of disease as studied in epidemiology is part of the field of public health errors and weaknesses errors of the immune system may cause damage in autoimmune diseases the body attacks parts of itself because the system mistakes some parts of the body as foreign some kinds of arthritis are caused this way sometimes serious pathogens slip in because their surface is disguised as something the host cell walls can accept that is how viruses work once inside a cell their genetic material controls the cell infections like hiv get in this way and then attack cells which are the basis of the immune system artificial means are often used to restore immune system function in an hiv challenged body and prevent the onset of aids this is one of the most complex issues in immunology as it involves every level of that system this research during the s and s radically changed the view of the human immune system and its functions and integration in the human body history of immunology immunology is a science that examines the structure and function of the immune system it originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease the earliest known mention of immunity was during the plague of athens in bc thucydides bc noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of some diseases could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time in the th century pierre louis moreau de maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom this and other observations of acquired immunity led to louis pasteur developing vaccination and the germ theory of disease pasteur s theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease such as the miasma theory it was not until the proofs robert koch published in for which he was awarded a nobel prize in that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in when the yellow fever virus was discovered by walter reed immunology made a great advance towards the end of the th century through rapid developments in the study of humoral immunity and cellular immunity particularly important was the work of paul ehrlich who proposed the side chain theory to explain the specificity of the antigen antibody reaction the nobel prize for was jointly awarded to ehrlich and the founder of cellular immunology ilya mechnikov the simplest form of immunity is the dna restriction system in bacteria that prevents infection by bacteriophages references related pages lymphatic system white blood cell the infinity symbol infinity is about things which never end sometimes it is also written infinity means many different things depending on when it is used the word is from a latin word which means without end infinity goes on forever so sometimes space numbers and other things are said to be infinite because they never come to a stop infinity is not really an ordinary number but it is sometimes used as one infinity often says how many there is of something instead of how big something is for example there are infinitely many whole numbers called integers but there is no integer which is infinitely big but different kinds of math have different kinds of infinity so its meaning often changes there are two kinds of infinity potential infinity and actual infinity potential infinity is a process that never stops for example adding to a number no matter how many times is added more can still be added actual infinity is a more abstract idea for example there are infinitely many numbers as it is impossible to write them all down infinity in mathematics mathematicians have different sizes of infinity and three different kinds of infinity counting infinity the number of things beginning with to include infinite cardinal numbers there are many different cardinal numbers infinity can be defined in one of two ways infinity is a number so big that a part of it can be of the same size infinity is larger than all of the natural numbers there is a smallest infinite number countable infinity it is the counting number for all of the whole numbers it is also the counting number of the rational numbers the mathematical notation is the hebrew letter aleph with a subscrpt zero it is spoken aleph null it was a surprise to learn that there are larger infinite numbers the number of real numbers that is all numbers with decimals is larger than the number of rational numbers the number of fractions this shows that there are real numbers which are not fractions the smallest infinite number greater than is the number of mathematical functions is the next infinite cardinal number and these numbers go on without end ordering infinity a different type of infinity are the ordinal numbers beginning first second third the order first second third and so on to infinity is different from the order ending third second first the difference is important for mathematical induction the simple first second third has the mathematical name the greek letter omega with subscript zero or simply omega the infinite series ending third second first is the real line and complex plane the third type of infinity has the symbol this is treated as addition to the real numbers or the complex numbers it is the result of division by zero or to indicate that a series is increasing or decreasing without bound the series increases without upper bound this is written the limit is in calculus the integral over all real numbers is written the arithmetic of infinity each kind of infinity has different rules addition multiplication exponentiation addition with alephs is commutative multiplication with alephs is commutative addition with omegas is not commutative multiplication with omegas is not

most people in japan live on one of four of the islands the biggest of these islands honshu has the most people honshu is the th largest island in the world tokyo is the capital of japan and its biggest city the japanese people call their country nihon or nippon which means the origin of the sun in japanese japan is a monarchy whose head of state is called the emperor history of japan the earliest records on japan are from chinese documents one of those records said there were many small countries in japan which had wars between them and later a country ruled by a queen became the strongest unified others and brought peace the japanese began to write their own history after the th and th centuries when people from korea and china taught japan about the chinese writing system japan s neighbours also taught them buddhism the japanese changed buddhism in many ways for example japanese buddhists used ideas such as zen more than other buddhists s in medieval europe japan had some contact with the europeans in the th century the portuguese were the first europeans to visit japan later the spanish english and dutch came to japan to trade also they brought christianity japan s leaders welcomed them at first but because europeans had conquered many places in the world the japanese were scared they would conquer japan too so the japanese did not let the europeans come into japan anymore except in a small area in nagasaki city many christians were killed only the chinese korean and dutch people were allowed to visit japan in the end and they were under careful control of the japanese government japan was opened for visitors again in by commodore matthew perry when the americans wanted to use japanese ports for american whale boats perry brought steamships with guns which scared the japanese into making an agreement with him this new contact with europeans and americans changed the japanese culture the meiji restoration of stopped some old ways and added many new ones the empire of japan was created and it became a very powerful nation and tried to invade the countries next to it it invaded and annexed ryukyu kingdom taiwan and korea it had wars with china and russia the first sino japanese war the boxer rebellion the russo japanese war and the second sino japanese war which grew to become a part of world war ii when japan became allies with nazi germany and fascist italy in japan attacked pearl harbor in hawaii a water base of the united states and destroyed or damaged many ships and airplanes this started the united states involvement in world war ii american and japanese forces fought each other in the pacific once airbases were established within range of the japanese mainland america began to win and started dropping bombs on japanese cities america was able to bomb most of the important cities and quickly brought japan close to defeat to make japan surrender the united states dropped two atomic bombs on the cities of hiroshima and nagasaki killing japanese citizens soon after this the soviet union began to fight against japan and the japanese army in manchuria lost japan surrendered and gave up all the places it took from other countries accepting the potsdam proclamation the united states occupied japan and forced it to write a new constitution in which it promised to never go to war again geography japan is a group of islands in the western pacific off the coast of china the four biggest islands are honshu hokkaido shikoku and kyushu and there are about smaller islands there japan is separated from the asian continent by the sea of japan and the east china sea honshu which means mainland in the japanese language is the biggest island hokkaido is the island north of honshu kyushu is the island west of honshu shikoku is the island to the south west of honshu in the middle of japan there are mountains they cover the middle of the islands and leave a very narrow strip of flat land on most coasts many of the mountains are extinct volcanoes but some are still active the highest of these mountains is the beautiful volcano shaped mt fuji metres or feet high japan has many earthquakes in fact there are about of these every year the most recent big earthquake was in called tohoku earthquake it caused great damage to several power plants forcing japan to shut down all its nuclear plants there was nuclear core meltdown which caused a serious health risk to nearby villages and cities of the people living in japan live in just of the land near the coast the other of the people in japan live away from the coast over cities have more than a million people in them the biggest city in japan is tokyo which is the capital tokyo politics and government the ruling party is the liberal democratic party japan and prime minister is shinzo abe the legislature of japan is called the national diet science and technology in the past the japanese learned science by way of china or from europe in the meiji era however in recent decades japan has been a leading innovator in several fields including chemical engineering nanotechnology and robotics there are many technological companies in japan and these companies make products for export the robot asimo was made and introduced in it was manufactured by honda society and culture many things in japanese culture originated in china like go and bonsai japan s traditional food is seafood rice miso soup and vegetables noodles and tofu are also common sushi a japanese food made of cooked rice with vinegar with other ingredients such as raw fish is popular around the world the religion in japan is mostly shinto and buddhist due to the tolerant nature of the two main japanese religions and the resulting intermixing of the two many japanese identify as both shinto and buddhist at the same time there are small numbers of christians and muslims and a few jews when it comes to popular culture japan is famous for making video games many of the biggest companies that make games like nintendo namco and sega are japanese other well known parts of japanese arts are comics called manga and digital animation or anime many people get to know

is the largest planet in the solar system it is the fifth planet from the sun jupiter is a gas giant both because it is so large and made up of gas the other gas giants are saturn uranus and neptune jupiter has a mass of kg or about earths this is twice the mass of all the other planets in the solar system put together jupiter can be seen even without the use of telescope it was known to the ancient romans who named it after their god jupiter latin iuppiter jupiter is the third brightest object in the night sky only the earth s moon and venus are brighter jupiter has at least moons of these around are very small and less than five kilometres wide the four largest moons of jupiter are io europa ganymede and callisto they are called the galilean moons because galileo galilei discovered them ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system it is larger in diameter than even mercury in another very small moons were discovered structure jupiter is the biggest planet in the solar system with a diameter of km this is eleven times bigger than the diameter of earth an animation of part of jupiter s cloud system the animation is made of over photographs taken by the cassini spacecraft between october and november four photographs of jupiter taken in the bright white spots are explosions where parts of the comet shoemaker levy hit the planet a picture by an artist of the voyager spacecraft that flew past jupiter in atmosphere the atmosphere near the surface of jupiter is made of about to hydrogen to helium and other gases the lower atmosphere is so heated and the pressure so high that helium changes to liquid it rains down onto the planet based on spectroscopy jupiter seems to be made of the same gases as saturn it is different from neptune or uranus these two planets have much less hydrogen and helium gas the very high temperatures and pressures in jupiter s core mean scientists cannot tell what materials would be there this cannot be found out because it is not possible to create the same amount of pressure on earth above the unknown inner core is an outer core the outer core of jupiter is thick liquid hydrogen the pressure is high enough to make the hydrogen solid but then it melts because of the heat mass jupiter is twice as massive as all the other planets in the solar system put together it gives off more heat than it gets from the sun jupiter is times the width of earth and times as massive the volume of jupiter is times the volume of earth in other words earth sized objects could fit inside it cloud layers jupiter has many bands of clouds going horizontally across its surface the light parts are zones and the darker are belts the zones and belts often interact with each other this causes huge storms wind speeds of kilometres per hour km h are common on jupiter to show the difference the strongest tropical storms on earth are about km h most of the clouds on jupiter are made of ammonia there may also be clouds of water vapour like clouds on earth spacecrafts such as voyager have seen lightning on the surface of the planet scientists think it was water vapour because lightning needs water vapour these lightning bolts have been measured as up times as powerful as those on earth the brown and orange colours are caused when sunlight passes through or refracts with the many gases in the atmosphere great red spot one of the biggest features in jupiter s atmosphere is the great red spot it is a huge storm which is bigger than the entire earth it is on record since at least and as early as images by the hubble space telescope have shown as many as two smaller red spots right next to the great red spot storms can last for hours or as long as hundreds of years in the case of the great red spot magnetic field jupiter has a magnetic field like earth s but times stronger it also has a magnetosphere much bigger and stronger than earth s the field traps radiation belts much stronger than earth s van allen radiation belts strong enough to endanger any spacecraft travelling past or to jupiter the magnetic field is probably caused by the large amounts of liquid metallic hydrogen in the core of jupiter the four largest moons of jupiter and many of the smaller ones orbit or go around the planet within the magnetic field this protects them from the solar wind jupiter s magnetic field is so large it reaches the orbit of saturn million miles million km away the earth s magnetosphere does not even cover its moon less than a quarter of a million miles km away ring system jupiter also has a thin planetary ring system these rings are difficult to see and were not discovered until by nasa s voyager probe there are four parts to jupiter s rings the closest ring to jupiter is called the halo ring the next ring is called the main ring it is about wide and only thick the main and halo rings of jupiter are made of small dark particles the third and fourth rings called the gossamer rings are transparent see through and are made from microscopic debris and dust this dust probably comes from small meteors striking the surface of jupiter s moons the third ring is called the amalthea gossamer ring named after moon amalthea the outer ring the thebe gossamer ring is named after the moon thebe the outer edge of this ring is about from jupiter orbit the orbit of a planet is the time and path it takes to go around the sun in the amount of time it takes for jupiter to orbit the sun one time the earth orbits the sun times one year on jupiter is equal to years on earth the average distance between jupiter and the sun is million kilometres this is five times the distance between earth and the sun jupiter is not tilted on its axis as much as earth or mars this causes it to have no seasons for example summer or winter jupiter rotates or spins around very quickly this causes the planet to bulge in the middle jupiter is the fastest spinning planet in the solar system it completes one rotation or spin in hours because of the bulge the length of the equator of jupiter is much longer than the length from pole to pole research and exploration from earth jupiter is the third brightest object in the night sky after the moon and venus because of that people have always been able to see it from earth the first person known to really study the planet was galileo galilei in he was the first person to see jupiter s moons io europa ganymede and callisto this was because he used a telescope unlike anyone before him no new moons were discovered for more than two hundred years in astronomer e e barnard found a new moon using his observatory in california he called the moon amalthea it was the last of jupiter s moons to be discovered by human observation through a telescope in bits of the comet shoemaker levy hit jupiter it was the first time people saw a collision between two solar system objects from spacecraft seven spacecraft have flown past jupiter since these were pioneer pioneer voyagers and ulysses and cassini and new horizons the pioneer missions were the first spacecraft to take close up pictures of jupiter and its moons five years later the two voyager spacecraft discovered over new moons they captured photo evidence of lightning on the night side of jupiter the ulysses probe was sent to study the sun it only went to jupiter after it had finished its main mission ulysses had no cameras so it took no photographs in the cassini spacecraft on its way to saturn took some very good very clear pictures of the planet cassini also found a moon and took a picture of it but it was too far away to show the details the galileo mission in was the first spacecraft to go into orbit around jupiter it flew around the planet for seven years and studied the four biggest moons it launched a probe into the planet to get information about jupiter s atmosphere the probe travelled to a depth of about km before it was crushed by the weight of all the gas above it this is called pressure the galileo spacecraft was also crushed in when nasa steered the craft into the planet they did this so that the craft could not crash into europa a moon which scientists think might have life nasa have sent another spacecraft to jupiter called juno it was launched on august the spacecraft arrived at jupiter on july several missions have been planned to send spacecraft to jupiter s moons europa and callisto one called jimo jupiter icy moons orbiter was cancelled in because it cost too much money moons jupiter has known moons the four largest were seen by galileo with his primitive telescope and nine more can be seen from earth with modern telescopes the rest of the moons have been identified by spacecraft the smallest moon s j is only one kilometre across the largest ganymede has a diameter of kilometres it is bigger than the planet mercury the other three galilean moons are io europa and callisto because of the way they orbit jupiter gravity affects three of these moons greatly the friction caused by the gravity of europa and ganymede pulling on io makes it the most volcanic object in the solar system it has over volcanoes more than three times as many as earth jupiter in the solar system a diagram of the inner solar system it shows the two groups of trojan asteroids that follow jupiter in its orbit jupiter s large gravity has had a big effect on the solar system jupiter protects the inner planets from comets by pulling them towards itself because of this jupiter has the most comet impacts in the solar system two groups of asteroids called trojan asteroids have settled into jupiter s orbit round the sun one group is called the trojans and the other group is called the greeks they go around the sun at the same time as

everything because of inheritance a king usually comes to power when the previous monarch dies who is usually a family member of his sometimes a person may become king due to the previous monarch s abdication for example george vi for most of history most countries were ruled in this way especially in europe some countries such as france are no longer monarchies some such as the united kingdom still have a royal family in some countries people chose a new king from other people to decide from the wife of a king is called a queen a woman who becomes a ruler because of inheritance is also

things which are true as opposed to opinion information which is correct is knowledge knowledge can always be supported by evidence if a statement is not supported by evidence then it is not knowledge the evidence makes it justified it is not an opinion or a guess knowledge can refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject this was the point of ryle s distinction between knowing that and knowing how it can be implicit as with practical skill or expertise or explicit as with the theoretical understanding of a subject it can be more or less formal or systematic in philosophy the study of knowledge is called epistemology the philosopher plato defined knowledge as justified true belief this definition is the subject of the gettier problems all knowledge is a claim to be true but the claim can be incorrect the only claims propositions which are certainly true are circular based on how we use words or terms we can correctly claim that there are degrees in a circle since that is part of how circles are defined the point of aristotle s syllogism was to show that this kind of reasoning had a machine like form if all swans are white and this is a swan then it must be white but actually in the real world not all swans are white the most widely accepted way to find reliable knowledge is the scientific method yet one thing all philosophers of science agree is that there is that scientific knowledge is just the best we can do at any one time all scientific knowledge is provisional not a claim of absolute truth religion and knowledge knowledge in religion is different in that it depends on faith belief and the authority of religious leaders not on evidence of a scientific or legal kind there are differing views on whether religious statements should be regarded as knowledge in many expressions of christianity such as catholicism and anglicanism knowledge is one of the seven gifts of the holy spirit in the garden of eden knowledge is the factor that

language though other animals communicate through other means human language has syntax a set of rules for connecting words together to make statements and questions language can also be changed by adding new words for example to describe new things other animals may inherit a set of calls which have pre set functions language may be done by speech or by writing or by moving the hands to make signs it follows that language is not just any way of communicating even some human communication is not language see non verbal communication humans also use language for thinking when people use the

type of school subject unesco says that languages are at risk of becoming extinct universals of language all languages share certain things which separate them from all other kinds of communication a language has rules which are shared by a community all human languages are based on sound and hearing or in the case of sign language vision all the basic sound units or phonemes have this in common they can be spoken by the human voice and heard by the human ear the sounds come out in a sequence not all at once this is mimicked in writing where the marks are put on the paper or screen in the same sequence the stream of sounds have little gaps between them and come in bigger packages we call the bigger packets sentences or questions or replies or comments in most languages english being

only way to keep track of spoken information all languages constantly evolve new words appear new forms of saying things new accents there are many more things in common between languages inheritance the capacity to learn and use language is inherited normally all humans are born with this capability which language is learned by a child depends on which language is spoken by the child s community the capacity is inherited but the particular language is learned children have a special period from about months to about four years which is critical for learning the language if this is seriously disrupted then their language skills will be damaged older people learn differently so they seldom learn a second language as well as they learn their native language types of language mathematics and computer science use created languages called formal languages like computer programming languages but these may or may not be true languages mathematics itself is seen as a language by many some people consider musical notation to be a way of writing the musical language chinese is the language with the most native speakers in the world but chinese is not really a language it is a close family of dialects some of which are as different as romance languages are from one another english is often called the international language or lingua franca it is the main second language of the

mandarin million native speakers p some languages are made up so that a lot of people around the world can learn them without the new languages being tied to any specific country or place these are called constructed languages one of the most popular of these languages is esperanto which is sometimes called la internacia lingvo or the international language another of these languages is called volapk which was popular about a hundred years ago but is much less popular now it has mostly been replaced by languages like esperanto interlingua and ido part of the reason that volapk became

so that they can do things they could not do near home other people prefer to spend their vacation time at home in their own community in rich industrialized countries such as the us and canada as well as in most european countries workers are allowed to stay home on the weekend usually saturday and sunday and use it as leisure time people in poorer developing countries usually have less

recording it may be a recording made in a studio live can also mean full of energy or simply happening now something that is being talked about in the newspapers at the moment can be a live issue earth is the only planet in the universe from which life is known the cradle and home of humanity and of all known forms of life life is a biological concept regarding the characteristics state or mode that separates a living thing from dead matter the word itself may refer to a living being or ongoing processes of which living things are a part of it may also refer to the period during which something is functional as between birth and death the condition of an entity that has been born but yet has to die or that which makes a living thing alive the study of life is called biology and people who study life are called biologists a lifespan is the average length of life in a species all known life on earth is powered by solar energy without energy from the sun no life could exist all life on earth is based on the chemistry of carbon compounds specifically involving long chain molecules such as proteins and nucleic acid with water which is essential the long molecules are wrapped inside membranes to form cells this may or may not be true of all possible forms of life in the universe it is true of all life on earth today summary living organisms are open systems they are always changing because they exchange materials and information with their environment they undergo metabolism maintain homeostasis possess a capacity to grow respond to stimuli and reproduce through natural selection they adapt to their environment in successive generations more complex living organisms can communicate through various means many life forms can be found on earth the properties common to these organisms plants animals fungi protists archaea and bacteria are a carbon and water based cellular form with complex organization and heritable genetic information at present the earth is the only planet we have detailed information about the question of whether life exists elsewhere in the universe is open there have been a number of claims of life elsewhere in the universe none of these have been confirmed so far the best evidence of life outside of earth is are nucleic acids that have been found in certain types of meteorites definitions of life one explanation of life is called the cell theory the cell theory has three basic points all living things are made up of cells the cell is the smallest living thing that can do all the things needed for life all cells must come from pre existing cells something is often said to be alive if it grows takes in food uses the food for energy and passes waste products see metabolism moves it must either move itself or have movement inside itself reproduces either sexually with another living thing or asexually by creating copies of itself reacts to its surroundings functions however not all living things fit every point on this list mules cannot reproduce and neither can worker ants viruses and spores are not actively alive metabolising until the conditions are right they do however fit the biochemical definitions they are made of the same kind of chemicals the thermodynamic definition of life is any system which can keep its entropy levels below maximum usually through adaptation and mutations a modern approach a modern definition was given by humberto maturana and francisco varela in to which they gave the name autopoiesis the production of their own components the correct assembly of these components continuous repair and maintenance of their own existence roth commented that in short organisms are self reproducing and self maintaining or autopoietic systems this approach makes use of molecular biology ideas

rules decided by a particular state meant for the purpose of keeping the peace and security of society courts or police may enforce this system of rules and punish people who break the laws such as by paying a fine or other penalty including jail in ancient societies laws were written by leaders to set out rules on how people can live work and do business with each other but many times in history when laws have been on a false basis to benefit few at the expense of society they have resulted in conflict to prevent this in most countries today laws are written and voted on by groups of politicians in a legislature such as a parliament or congress elected chosen by the governed peoples countries today have a constitution for the overall framework of society and make further laws as needed for matters of detail members of society generally have enough freedom within all the legal things they can choose to do an activity is illegal if it breaks a law or does not follow the laws a legal code is a written code of laws that are enforced this may deal with things like police courts or punishments a lawyer jurist or attorney is a professional who studies and argues the rules of law in the united states there are two kinds of attorneys transactional attorneys who write contracts and litigators who go to court in the united kingdom these professionals are called solicitors and barristers respectively the rule of law is the law which says that government can only legally use its power in a way the government and the people agree on it limits the powers a government has as agreed in a country s constitution the rule of law prevents dictatorship and protects the rights of the people when leaders enforce the legal code honestly even on themselves and their friends this is an example of the rule of law being followed the rule of law wrote the ancient greek philosopher aristotle in bc is better than the rule of any individual culture is usually a major source of the principles behind many laws and people also tend to trust the ideas based on family and social habits in many countries throughout history religion and religious books like the vedas bible or the koran have been a major source of law types of law contract law sets rules on agreements to buy and sell items and services medical law sets rules and guidelines for medical professionals it also states a patient s own medical rights physician patient privilege protects the patient s private conversations with a medical physician doctor this also extends to their personal information like their contact details shared with medical personnel property law states the rights and obligations that a person has when they buy sell or rent homes and land called real property or realty and objects called personal property intellectual property ip law involves the rights people have over things they create such as art music and literature this is called copyright it also protects inventions that people make by a kind of law called patent it also covers the rights people have to the names of a company or a distinctive mark or logo this is called trademark trust law business law sets out the rules for money that is put into an investment such as pension funds that people save up for their retirement it involves many different types of law including administrative and property law tort law helps people to make claims for compensation repayment when someone hurts them or hurts their property criminal law is used by the government to prevent people from breaking laws and punish people who do break them constitutional law deals with the important rights of the government and its relationship with the people it mainly involves the interpretation of a constitution including things like the separation of powers of the different branches of government a court order is an official proclamation by a judge that defines and authorizes the carrying out of certain steps for one or more parties to a case administrative law is used by ordinary citizens who want to challenge decisions made by governments it also involves things like regulations and the operation of the administrative agencies international law is used to set out rules on how countries can act in areas such as trade the environment or military action the geneva conventions on the conduct of war and the roerich pact are examples of international law custom and tradition are practices that are widely adopted and agreed upon in a society thought often not in a written form custom and tradition can be enforced in courts and are sometimes considered as part of the legal reasoning in matters decided in courts in some societies and cultures all law is or was custom and tradition though this is increasingly rare although there are some parts of the world where custom tradition are still binding or even the predominant form of law for example tribal lands or failed states civil law and common law civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today civil law is based on legislation that is found in constitutions or statutes passed by government the secondary part of civil law is the legal approaches that are part of custom in civil law governments judges do not generally have much power and most of the laws and legal precedent are created by members of parliament common law is based on the decisions made by judges in past court cases it comes from england and it became part of almost every country that once belonged to the british empire except malta scotland the u s state of louisiana and the canadian province of quebec it is also the predominant form of law in the united states where many laws called statutes are written by congress but many more legal rules exist from the decisions of the courts common law had its beginnings in the middle ages when king john was forced by his barons to sign a document called the magna carta religious law religious law is law based on religious beliefs or books examples include the jewish halakha islamic sharia and christian canon law until the s sharia law was the main legal system throughout the muslim world in some muslim countries such as saudi arabia and iran the whole legal systems still base their law on sharia law islamic law is often criticised because it often has harsh penalties for crimes a serious criticism is the judgement of the european court that sharia is incompatible with the fundamental principles of democracy the turkish refah party s sharia based plurality of legal systems grounded on religion was ruled to contravene the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the court decided refah s plan would do away with the state s role as the guarantor of individual rights and freedoms and infringe the principle of non discrimination between individuals as regards their enjoyment of public freedoms which is one of the fundamental principles of democracy history of law the history of law is closely connected to the development of human civilizations ancient egyptian law developed in bc in bc king hammurabi took ancient babylonian law and organized it and had it chiseled in stone for the public to see in the marketplace these laws became known as the code of hammurabi the torah from the old testament is an old body of law it was written around bc it has moral rules such as the ten commandments which tell people what things are not permitted sometimes people try to change the law for example if prostitution is illegal they try to make it legal legislature in democracies the people in a country usually choose people called politicians to represent them in a legislature examples of legislatures include the houses of parliament in london the congress in washington d c the bundestag in berlin the duma in moscow and the assemble nationale in paris most legislatures have two chambers or houses a lower house and an upper house to pass legislation a majority of members of parliament must vote for a bill in each house the legislature is the branch of government that writes laws and votes on whether they will be approved judiciary the judiciary is a group of judges who resolve people s disputes and determine whether people who are charged with crimes are guilty in some jurisdictions the judge does not find guilt or innocence but instead directs a jury how to interpret facts from a legal perspective but the jury determines the facts based on evidence presented to them and finds the guilt or innocences of the charged person most countries of common law and civil law systems have a system of appeals courts up to a supreme authority such as the supreme court or the high court the highest courts usually have the power to remove laws that are unconstitutional which go against the constitution executive government and head of state the executive is the governing center of political authority in most democratic countries the executive is elected from people who are in the legislature this group of elected people is called the cabinet in france the us and russia the executive branch has a president which exists separately from the legislature the executive suggests new laws and deals with other countries as well the executive usually controls the military the police and the bureaucracy the executive selects ministers or secretaries of state to control departments such as the health department or the department of justice in many jurisdictions the head of state does not take part in the day to day governance of the jurisdiction and takes a largely ceremonial role this is the case in many commonwealth nations where the head of state usually a governor almost exclusively acts on the advice of the head of the executive e g the prime minister first minister or premier the primary legal role of the head of state in these jurisdictions is to act as a check or balance against the executive as the head of state has the rarely exercised power to dissolve the legislature call elections and dismiss ministers other parts of the legal system the police enforce the criminal laws by arresting people suspected of breaking the law bureaucrats are the government workers and government organizations that do work for the government bureaucrats work within a system of rules and they make their decisions in writing lawyers are people who have learned about laws lawyers give people advice about their legal rights and duties and represent people in court to become a lawyer a person has to complete a two or three year university program at a law school and pass an entrance examination lawyers work in law firms for the government for companies or by themselves civil society is the people and groups that are not part of government that try to protect people against human rights abuses and try to protect freedom of speech and other individual rights organizations that are part of civil society include political parties debating clubs trade unions human rights organizations newspapers and charities corporations are among the organizations that use the legal system to further their goals like the others they use means such as campaign donations and advertising to persuade people that they are right corporations also engage in commerce and make new things such as automobiles vaporisers e cigarettes and unmanned aerial vehicles i e drones that the old laws are not well equipped to deal with corporations also makes use of a set of rules and regulations to ensure their employees remain loyal to them usually presented in a legal contract and that any disobedience towards these rules are considered uncivilized and therefore given

from an early age and spoke the language fluently later he learned french latin greek hebrew and english he also had an interest in italian spanish and lithuanian zamenhof decided that the international language must have a simple grammar and be easier to learn than volapk an earlier international language he attempted to create the international language with a grammar that was rich

which is used by most of the world while an ordinary year has days a leap year has days the extra day february is added to the month of february in an ordinary year february has days but in a leap year it has days the extra day called a leap day is the same day of the week as the first day of the month february also in a leap year the months of january april and july all start on the same day of the week a leap year comes once every four years because of this a leap year can always be evenly divided by four for example was a leap year but a year is a common year if it can be evenly divided by but not by this is why and are leap years but and are common years we have leap years because instead of days the earth really takes a few minutes less than days to go completely around the sun without leap years the seasons would start one day earlier on the calendar every four years after years spring in the northern hemisphere and autumn in the southern hemisphere which usually begins on march would begin on december which is when winter in the northern hemisphere and summer in the southern hemisphere presently begins a number of countries use a lunar calendar based on the moon instead of the sun like our solar calendar is they have leap years when they add an extra lunar month different calendars add the extra month in different ways so a year which has day s instead of days where the month of february has days is called a leap year related pages february common year century leap year shoes made of crocodile leather leather is the skin of an animal made into a

systems of linear equations vectors and matrices are used to solve these systems the main objects of study currently are vector spaces and linear mappings between vector spaces linear algebra is useful in other branches of mathematics e g differential equations and analytic geometry it can also be applied to the real world in areas such as engineering physics and economics linear algebra describes ways to solve and manipulate rearrange systems of linear equations for example consider the following equations these two equations form a system of linear equations it is linear because none of the variables are raised to a power the graph of a linear equation in two variables is a straight line the solution to this system is this is because it makes all of the original equations valid that is the value on the left side of the equals sign is exactly the same as the value on the right side for both equations linear algebra uses a system of notation for describing system behavior called a matrix for the previous example the coefficients of the equations can be stored in a coefficient matrix london is the capital and largest city of england and the united kingdom the

germany since new york city usa since moscow russia beijing china since partner cities paris france since rome italy london also has a partnership agreement with tokyo japan london transportation trains airports and metro the city has a huge network of transport systems including trains metros underground and five main airports the victorians built many train systems in the mid th century s their main stations are in london and the lines go to every part of great britain there were originally five major companies but the five companies became a national rail network in modern times there are five airports though only one is actually in london london city airport there is the london end of the londonbirmingham canal which was important to the industrial th century the most used airport is heathrow international airport although it is actually outside the city the metro or london underground is a system of electric trains which are in london united kingdom it is the oldest underground railway in the world it started running in as the metropolitan railway after the opening the system was copied in many other cities for example new york and madrid even though it is called the underground about half of it is above the ground the tube is a slang name for the london underground because the tunnels for some of the lines are round tubes running through the ground the underground has got stations and over km of track from over billion passengers used the underground references other websites london city government worldflicks in london photos and interesting places on google maps a litre international spelling or liter american spelling is one of the metric units of volume it is not an si unit one litre is the volume of cubic centimetres that is a cube of centimetres cm one litre of water at has the mass of exactly one kilogram this results from the definition given in where the gram was defined as the weight of one cubic centimetre of melting ice the symbols for litre are l l or for smaller volumes the decilitre is used dl one litre for smaller volumes the centilitre is used cl one litre for smaller volumes the millilitre is used ml one litre the capital letter l is preferred by some people as the small l can look like the number one litre imperial gallons litre us gallons imperial gallon litres us gallon litres litre dm history the metric system was first introduced in france in that system did not have its own unit of capacity or volume because volume can be measured in cubic metres in work to make the metric system compulsory in france was started by the temporary commission of republican weights and measures due to public demand the commission said that the cubic metre was too big for everyday use they said that a new unit based on the old cadil should be used instead one cadil was to be cubic metres this was equivalent to a cube with sides cm the cadil was also known as the pinte or the litron the pinte had been an old french unit of measure of capacity in the definition was revised the cadil was given the name litre in the kilogram was defined to be exactly one litre of water at c in the kilogram was redefined the new definition said that the kilogram was the mass of the kilogram des archives in scientists measured the volume of one litre of water at c very carefully they found that it occupied about dm the bipm redefined the litre as being exactly the volume of one kilogram of water at c in the si was introduced the bipm changed the definition of the litre back to one dm the litre is not part of si the bipm defined the litre as a non si unit accepted for use with the si this was because it is used in many countries the bipm said that the litre should not be used very very accurate work according to si rules the symbol for the litre should be l this is because the litre was not named after somebody whose name was litre however the symbol l and the number are easily confused in the bipm made an exception for the symbol for the litre they said that people could use either l or l as its symbol notes references two limes lime is a fruit tree and the fruit itself they are citrus fruits similar to lemons limes are rich in vitamin c sailors from britain were given lemon or lime juice to stop them falling ill with scurvy this is how they got the nickname limey limes are small round and bright green if they stay on the tree for a long time they turn yellow then they look like small round lemons lime juice is used in cooking and in drinks lime oils are often used in perfumes used for cleaning and used for aromatherapy lime tastes acidic and bitter lime juice is also made from limes different kinds of limes persian lime this lime is most often sold in supermarkets as lime key lime

shortened to maths in england australia ireland and new zealand or math in the united states and canada the short words are often used for arithmetic geometry or simple algebra by students and their schools mathematics includes the study of numbers how things can be counted structure how things are organized this subfield is usually called algebra place where things are and their arrangement this subfield is usually called geometry change how things become different this subfield is usually called analysis mathematics is useful for solving problems that occur in the real world so many people besides mathematicians study and use mathematics today some mathematics is needed in many jobs people working in business science engineering and construction need some knowledge of mathematics problem solving in mathematics mathematics solves problems by using logic one of the main tools of logic used by mathematicians is deduction deduction is a special way of thinking to discover and prove new truths using old truths to a mathematician the reason something is true called a proof is just as important as the fact that it is true and this reason is often found using deduction using deduction is what makes mathematics thinking different from other kinds of scientific thinking which might rely on experiments or on interviews logic and reasoning are used by mathematicians to create general rules which are an important part of mathematics these rules leave out information that is not important so that a single rule can cover many situations by finding general rules mathematics solves many problems at the same time as these rules can be used on other problems these rules can be called theorems if they have been proved or conjectures if it is not known if they are true yet most mathematicians use non logical and creative reasoning in order to find a logical proof sometimes mathematics finds and studies rules or ideas that we don t understand yet often in mathematics ideas and rules are chosen because they are considered simple or neat on the other hand sometimes these ideas and rules are found in the real world after they are studied in mathematics this has happened many times in the past in general studying the rules and ideas of mathematics can help us understand the world better some examples of math problems are addition subtraction multiplication division calculus fractions and decimals algebra problems are solved by evaluating certain variables a calculator answers every math problem in the four basic arithmetic operations areas of study in mathematics number mathematics includes the study of numbers and quantities most of the areas listed below are studied in many different fields of mathematics including set theory and mathematical

through harmonic frequencies music is also a form of entertainment that puts sounds together in a way that people like find interesting or dance to most music includes people singing with their voices or playing musical instruments such as the piano guitar drums or violin the word music comes from the greek word mousike which means art of the muses in ancient greece the muses included the goddesses of music poetry art and dance someone who makes music is known as a musician definition of music music is sound that has been organized by using rhythm melody or harmony if someone bangs saucepans while cooking it makes noise if a person bangs saucepans or pots in a rhythmic way they are making a simple type of music there are four things which music has most of the time music often has pitch this means high and low notes tunes are made of notes that go up or down or stay on the same pitch music often has rhythm rhythm is the way the musical sounds and silences are put together in a sequence every tune has a rhythm that can be tapped music usually has a regular beat music often has dynamics this means whether it is quiet or loud or somewhere in between music often has timbre this is a french word pronounced the french way tam br the timbre of a sound is the way that a sound is interesting the sort of sound might be harsh gentle dry warm or something else timbre is what makes a clarinet sound different from an oboe and what makes one person s voice sound different from another person definitions there is no simple definition of music which covers all cases it is an art form and opinions come into play music is whatever people think is music a different approach is to list the qualities music must have such as sound which has rhythm melody pitch timbre etc these and other attempts do not capture all aspects of music or leave out examples which definitely are music according to thomas clifton music is a certain reciprocal relation established between a person his behavior and a sounding object p musical experience and the music together are called phenomena and the activity of describing phenomena is called phenomenology history musicians of amun tomb of nakht th dynasty western thebes even in the stone age people made music the first music was probably made trying to imitate sounds and rhythms that occurred naturally human music may echo these phenomena using patterns repetition and tonality this kind of music is still here today shamans sometimes imitate sounds that are heard in nature it may also serve as entertainment games or have practical uses like attracting animals when hunting some animals also can use music songbirds use song to protect their territory or to attract a mate monkeys have been seen beating hollow logs this may of course also serve to defend the territory the first musical instrument used by humans was probably the voice the human voice can make many different kinds of sounds the larynx voice box is like a wind instrument the oldest known neanderthal hyoid bone with the modern human form was found in indicating that the neanderthals had language because the hyoid supports the voice box in the human throat most likely the first rhythm instruments or percussion instruments involved the clapping of hands stones hit together or other things that are useful to keep a beat there are finds of this type that date back to the paleolithic some of these are ambiguous as they can be used either as a tool or a musical instrument the first flutes the divje babe flute the oldest flute ever discovered may be the so called divje babe flute found in the slovenian cave divje babe i in it is not certain that the object is really a flute the item in question is a fragment of the femur of a young cave bear and has been dated to about years ago however whether it is truly a musical instrument or simply a carnivore chewed bone is a matter of ongoing debate in archaeologists discovered a bone flute in the hohle fels cave near ulm germany the five holed flute has a v shaped mouthpiece and is made from a vulture wing bone the researchers involved in the discovery officially published their findings in the journal nature in june the discovery is also the oldest confirmed find of any musical instrument in history other flutes were also found in the cave this flute was found next to the venus of hohle fels and a short distance from the oldest known human carving when they announced their discovery the scientists suggested that the finds demonstrate the presence of a well established musical tradition at the time when modern humans colonized europe the oldest known wooden pipes were discovered near greystones ireland in a wood lined pit contained a group of six flutes made from yew wood

or seven note scale of xia zhi and six note scale of qing shang of the ancient chinese musical system periods in music history dates prehistoric music ancient music medieval musicrenaissance musicbaroque musicclassical period music romantic music modern period before writing before about today ancient times it is not known what the earliest music of the cave people was like some architecture even some paintings are thousands of years old but old music could not survive until people learned to write it down the only way we can guess about early music is by looking at very old paintings that show people playing musical instruments or by finding them in archaeological digs digging underground to find old things the earliest piece of music that was ever written down and that has not been lost was discovered on a tablet written in hurrian a language spoken in and around northern mesopotamia where iraq is today from about bc the oxfords companion to music ed percy scholes london middle ages another early piece of written music that has survived was a round called sumer is icumen in it was written down by a monk around the year much of the music in the middle ages roughly was folk music played by working people who wanted to sing or dance when people played instruments they were usually playing for dancers however most of the music that was written down was for the catholic church this music was written for monks to sing in church it is called chant or gregorian chant renaissance in the renaissance roughly there was a lot of music and many composers wrote music that has survived so that it can be performed played or sung today the name for this period renaissance is a french word which means rebirth this period was called the rebirth because many new types of art and music were reborn during this time some very beautiful music was written for use in church services sacred music by the italian composer giovanni da palestrina in palestrina s music many singers sing together this is called a choir there was also plenty of music not written for the church such as happy dance music and romantic love songs popular instruments during the renaissance included the viols a string instrument played with a bow lutes a plucked stringed instrument that is a little like a guitar and the virginal a small quiet keyboard instrument baroque in the arts the baroque was a western cultural era which began near the turn of the th century in rome it was exemplified by drama and grandeur in sculpture painting literature dance and music in music the term baroque applies to the final period of dominance of imitative counterpoint where different voices and instruments echo each other but at different pitches sometimes inverting the echo and even reversing thematic material the popularity and success of the baroque style was encouraged by the roman catholic church which had decided at the time of the council of trent that the arts should communicate religious themes in direct and emotional involvement the upper class also saw the dramatic style of baroque architecture and art as a means of impressing visitors and expressing triumphant power and control baroque palaces are built around an entrance of courts grand staircases and reception rooms of sequentially increasing opulence in similar profusions of detail art music architecture and literature inspired each other in the baroque cultural movement as artists explored what they could create from repeated and varied patterns some traits and aspects of baroque paintings that differentiate this style from others are the abundant amount of details often bright polychromy less realistic faces of subjects and an overall sense of awe which was one of the goals in baroque art the word baroque probably derives from the ancient portuguese noun barroco which is a pearl that is not round but of unpredictable and elaborate shape hence in informal usage the word baroque can simply mean that something is elaborate with many details without reference to the baroque styles of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries classical period in western music the classical period means music from about to it was the time of composers like joseph haydn wolfgang amadeus mozart and ludwig van beethoven orchestras became bigger and composers often wrote longer pieces of music called symphonies that had several sections called movements some movements of a symphony were loud and fast other movements were quiet and sad the form of a piece of music was very important at this time music had to have a nice shape they often used a structure which was called sonata form another important type of music was the string quartet which is a piece of music written for two violins a viola and a violoncello like symphonies string quartet music had several sections haydn mozart and beethoven each wrote many famous string quartets the piano was invented during this time composers liked the piano because it could be used to play dynamics getting louder or getting softer other popular instruments included the violin the violoncello the flute the clarinet and the oboe romantic period the th century is called the romantic period composers were particularly interested in conveying their emotions through music an important instrument from the romantic period was the piano some composers such as frederic chopin wrote subdued expressive quietly emotional piano pieces often music described a feeling or told a story using sounds other composers such as franz schubert wrote songs for a singer and a piano player called lied the german word for song these lieder plural of lied told stories by using the lyrics words of the song and by the imaginative piano accompaniments other composers like richard strauss and franz liszt created narratives and told stories using only music which is called a tone poem composers such as franz liszt and johannes brahms used the piano to play loud dramatic strongly emotional music many composers began writing music for bigger orchestras with as many as instruments it was the period of nationalism the feeling of being proud of one s country when many composers made music using folksong or melodies from their country lots of famous composers lived at this time such as franz schubert felix mendelssohn frederic chopin johannes brahms pyotr tchaikovsky and richard wagner modern times from about onwards is called the modern period many th century composers wanted to compose music that sounded different from the classical and romantic music modern composers searched for new ideas such as using new instruments different forms different sounds or different harmonies the composer arnold schoenberg wrote pieces which were atonal meaning that they did not sound as if they were in any clear musical key later schoenberg invented a new system for writing music called twelve tone system music written with the twelve tone system sounds strange to some but is mathematical in nature often making sense only after careful study pure twelve tone music was popular among academics in the fifties and sixties but some composers such as benjamin britten use it today when it is necessary to get a certain feel one of the most important th century composers igor stravinsky wrote music with very complicated difficult chords groups of notes that are played together and rhythms some composers thought music was getting too complicated and so they wrote minimalist pieces which use very simple ideas in the s and s composers such as karlheinz stockhausen experimented with electronic music using electronic circuits amplifiers and loudspeakers in the s composers began using electronic synthesizers and musical instruments from rock and roll music such as the electric guitar they used these new instruments to make new sounds composers writing in the s and the s such as john adams born and james macmillan born often use a mixture of all these ideas but they like to write tonal music with easy tunes as well electronic music music can be produced electronically this is most commonly done by computers keyboards electric guitars and disk tables they can mimic traditional instruments and also produce very different sounds st century electronic music is commonly made with computer programs and hardware mixers jazz jazz is a type of music that was invented around in new orleans in the south of the usa there were many black musicians living there who played a style of music called blues music blues music was influenced by african music because the black people in the united states had come to the united states as slaves they were taken from africa by force blues music was a music that was played by singing using the harmonica or the acoustic guitar many blues songs had sad lyrics about sad emotions feelings or sad experiences such as losing a job a family member dying or having to go to jail prison jazz music mixed together blues music with european music some black composers such as scott joplin were writing music called ragtime which had a very different rhythm from standard european music but used notes that were similar to some european music ragtime was a big influence on early jazz called dixieland jazz jazz musicians used instruments such as the trumpet saxophone and clarinet were used for the tunes melodies drums for percussion and plucked double bass piano banjo and guitar for the background rhythm rhythmic section jazz is usually improvised the players make up invent the music as they play even though jazz musicians are making up the music jazz music still has rules the musicians play a series of chords groups of notes in order jazz music has a swinging rhythm the word swing is hard to explain for a rhythm to be a swinging rhythm it has to feel natural and relaxed swing rhythm is not even like a march there is a long short feel instead of a same same feel a swinging rhythm also gets the people who are listening excited because they like the sound of it some people say that a swinging rhythm happens when all the jazz musicians start to feel the same pulse and energy from the song if a jazz band plays very well together people will say that is a swinging jazz band or that band really swings well jazz influenced other types of music like the western art music from the s and s art music composers such as george gershwin wrote music that was influenced by jazz jazz music influenced pop music songs in the s and s many pop music songs began using chords or melodies from jazz songs one of the best known jazz musicians was louis armstrong pop music pop music is a type of popular music that many people like to listen to the term pop music can be used for all kinds of music that was written to be popular the word pop music was used from about onwards when a type of music called music was popular modern pop music grew out of s rock and roll for example chuck berry bo diddley and little richard and rockabilly for example elvis presley and buddy holly in the s the beatles became a famous pop music group in the s other styles of music were mixed with pop music such as funk and soul music pop music generally has a heavy strong beat so that it is good for dancing pop singers normally sing with microphones that are plugged into an amplifier and a loudspeaker musical notation mozart first movement of the piano sonata k an example of writing music in staffs musical notation is the way music is written down music needs to be written down in order to be saved and remembered for future performances in this way composers people who write music can tell others how to play the musical piece as it was meant to be played solfge solfge sometimes called solfa is the way tones are named it was made in order to give a name to the several tones and pitches for example the eight basic notes do re mi fa so la ti do are just the names of the eight notes that confirm the major scale written music music can be written in several ways when it is written on a staff like in the example shown the pitches tones and their duration are represented by symbols called notes notes are put on the lines and in the spaces between the lines each position says which tone must be played the higher the note is on the staff the higher the pitch of the tone the lower the notes are the lower the pitch the duration of the notes how long they are played for is shown by making the note heads black or white and by giving them stems and flags music can also be written with letters naming them as in the solfa do re mi fa so la ti do or representing them by letters the next table shows how each note of the solfa is represented in the standard notation solfa name standard notation do c re d mi e fa f sol g la a ti b the standard notation was made to simplify the lecture of music notes although it is mostly used to represent chords and the names of the music scales these ways to represent music ease the way a person reads music there are more ways to write and represent music but they are less known and may be more complicated how to enjoy music by listening people can enjoy music by listening to it they can go to concerts to hear musicians perform classical music is usually performed in concert halls but sometimes huge festivals are organized in which it is performed outside in a field or stadium like pop festivals people can listen to music on cds computers ipods television the radio cassette record players and even mobile phones there is so much music today in elevators shopping malls and stores that it often becomes a background sound that we do not really hear by playing or singing people can learn to play an instrument probably the most common for complete beginners is the piano or keyboard the guitar or the recorder which is certainly the cheapest to buy after they have learnt to play scales play simple tunes and read the simplest musical notation then they can think about which instrument for further development they should choose an instrument that is practical for their size for example a very short child cannot play a full size double bass because the double bass is over five feet high people should choose an instrument that they enjoy playing because playing regularly is the only way to get better finally it helps to have a good teacher by composing anyone can make up his or her own pieces of music it is not difficult to compose simple songs or melodies tunes it s easier for people who can play an instrument themselves all it takes is experimenting with the sounds that an instrument makes someone can make up a piece that tells a story or just find a nice tune and think about ways it can be changed each time it is repeated the instrument might be someone s own voice related pages classical music jazz music cuban music musical instrument orchestra pop music scale

in the left corner x money can be defined as anything that people use to buy goods and services money is what many people receive for selling their own things or services there are many kinds of money in the world most countries have their own kind of money such as the united states dollar or the british pound money is also called many other names like currency or cash and in india rupee history of money the idea of bartering things is very old a long time ago people did not buy or sell with money instead they traded one thing for another to get what they wanted or needed one person who owned many cows could trade with another person who had a lot of wheat each would trade a little of what he had with the other this would support the people on his farm other things that were easier to carry around than cows also came to be held as valuable this gave rise to trade items such as jewelry and spices when people changed from trading in things like for example cows and wheat to using money instead they needed things that would last a long time they must still have a known value and could be carried around the first country in the world to make metal coins was called lydia these first appeared during the th century bc in the western part of what is now turkey the lydian coins were made of a weighed amount of precious metal and were stamped with a picture of a lion this idea soon spread to greece the rest of the mediterranean and the rest of the world coins were all made to the same size and shape in some parts of the world different things have been used as money like clam shells or blocks of salt besides being easier to carry than cows using money had many other advantages money is easier to divide than many trade goods if someone own cows and wants to trade for only half a cow s worth of wheat he probably does not want to cut his cow in half but if he sells his cow for money and buys wheat with money he can get exactly the amount he wants cows die and wheat rots but money lasts longer than most trade goods if someone sells a cow for money he can save that money away until he needs it he can always leave it to his children when he dies it can last a very long time and he can use it at any time not every cow is as good as another cow some cows are sick and old and others are healthy and young some wheat is good and other wheat is moldy or stale so if a person trades cows for wheat he might have a hard time arguing over how much wheat each cow is worth however money is standard that means one dollar is worth the same as another dollar it is easier to add up and count money than to add up the value of different cows or amounts of wheat later after coins had been used for hundreds of years paper money started out as a promise to pay in coin much like an i o u note the first true paper money was used in china in the th century ad paper money was also printed in sweden between and both times it did not work well and had to be stopped because the banks kept running out of coins to pay on the notes massachusetts bay colony printed paper money in the s this time the use became more common today most of what people think of as money is not

which is the first subtraction which is the second and then there is multiplication with natural numbers it tells you the number of tiles in a rectangle where one of the two numbers equals the number of tiles on one side and the other number equals the number of tiles on the other side with real numbers it tells you the area of a rectangle where the first number equals the size of one side and the second number equals the size of the other side for example three multiplied by five is the total of five threes added together or the total of three fives this can be written down as or spoken as three times five equals fifteen mathematicians call the two numbers you wish to multiply coefficients together or multiplicand and multiplicator separately multiplicand multiplicator product multiplication between numbers is said to be commutative when the order of the numbers does not influence the value of the product this is true for the integers whole numbers e g is the same as and also for the rational numbers fractions and for all the other real numbers representable as a field in the continuous line and also for complex numbers numbers representable as a field in the plane it is not true for quaternions numbers representable as a ring in the four dimensional space vectors or matrices x the definition of multiplication as repeated addition provides a way to arrive at a set theoretic interpretation of multiplication of cardinal numbers a more accurate representation is to think of it as scaling quantities this animation illustrates being multiplied by giving as a result notice that the blue dot in the blue segment of length is placed at position and the blue segment is scaled so that this dot is placed at the end of the red segment of length for multiplication by any x the blue dot will always start at and end at x this works even for x smaller than or negative the opposite of multiplication is division multiplication table teachers usually require their pupils to

million muslims in canada and the united states million muslims in latin and central america million muslims in the european union plus bosnia herzegovina and albania few or none in eastern europe norway million muslims in turkey million muslims in the arab league including iraq with about million shia of the population muslims in sub saharan africa million muslims shia in iran million muslims in central asia in azerbaijan uzebekistan tajikistan kazakhstan kyrgyzstan turkmenistan formerly republics of the soviet union million muslims in russia million muslims in afghanistan million muslims in pakistan and bangladesh formerly east bengal provincial region million muslims in india included jammu and kashmir the world s largest minority population million muslims in china a close second million muslims in somalia million muslims in indonesia million muslims in the rest of south east asia especially malaysia few or none in japan australia new zealand mongolia or the south pacific billion people total media the al jazeera satellite tv network in the arabic language is a news source many muslims watch in most muslim nations the government is the main source of news this sometimes makes it very difficult or dangerous to make anti government statements there are however many other news programmes and websites in the muslim world islam in law and ethics islamic law exists in many variations in arabic it is called shariah five schools of which were created centuries ago these are the classical fiqh the hanafi school from india pakistan and bangaladesh west africa egypt the maliki in north africa and west africa the shafi in malaysia and indonesia the hanbali in arabia and jaferi in iran and iraq where the majority is shia all five are very old and many muslims feel a new fiqh must be created for modern society islam has a method for doing this al urf and ijtihad are the words to describe this method but they have not been used in a long time and few people are trusted enough to use them to make new laws so in most of the muslim world people are very conservative especially about alcohol adultery abortion and women working in jobs where they are used to lure customers muslim women often dress extremely modestly and many do so by choice but in some countries they have been forced to do so against their will this is one of the things that causes tension between the western world and that of muslims islamic economics bans debt but in most muslim countries western banking is allowed this is another issue that many muslims have with the western world islam in politics one quarter of the world population share islam as an ethical tradition many people in these countries also see islam as a political movement in democratic countries there is usually at least one islamic party political islam is powerful in all muslim majority countries islamic parties in pakistan and algeria have taken power many in these movements call themselves islamists which also sometimes describes more militant islamic groups the relationships between these groups and their views of democracy are complex some of these groups are called terrorists because they attack civilians of other non muslim nations to make a political point conflicts with israel and the us israel is very unpopular in the muslim world because of the israeli palestinian conflict and the way that the state of israel came into being in which many arabs thought was unfair some muslims see this as a fight against judaism or jews but not all in morocco for instance the islamists recently invited jews to join the party jewish groups also cooperate with arabs in the west bank where neturei karta anti zionist orthodox jewish leader rabbi mosche hirsch served as the minister for jewish affairs in the fatah before there was a palestinian authority like the arabs this small group of jews thought the way israel was created was not right however very few jews believe this and most support israel as a state in there was a big shift in the way the muslim world dealt with the rest of the world in that year egypt made peace with israel iran became an islamic state after a revolution and there was an invasion of afghanistan by the soviet union a lot of things changed in that year by the soviet union was gone jordan had also made peace with israel and on september there were major attacks on the u s which most people believe were made to drive the united states out of the muslim world especially saudi arabia in many ways the events of led to the events of the invasion of afghanistan and invasion of iraq are called part of a war on terrorism by the united states many or most muslims see it as a war on islam after the invasion the islamic parties won more seats and a majority of muslims polled in many nations expressed support for osama bin laden and said he would do the right thing olivier roy is a french scholar who thinks that this does not express support for al qaeda or militant islam but opposing colonialism and what many muslims call racism favourable treatment for jews especially those living in west bank settlements many of whom have american or british passport and which the united nations says have no right to live there the situation is very complicated and there are many different views of it organization the organization of islamic conference formed in lets the muslim nations work as a group russia joined in the arab league is a smaller group of only the arab countries opec is another forum where issues between the muslim and non muslim world come up in to protest u s support for israel there was an oil embargo which caused the energy crisis related pages history of islam hajj a multiverse or metaverse is the theory of a conjectured set of multiple possible universes including ours which make up reality these universes are sometimes called parallel universes a number of different versions have been considered the term multiverse was coined in by psychologist william james as a philosophical concept the cosmological multiverse the cosmological multiverse tries to explain why the universe we observe i e seems so welcoming to the emergence of life even small changes to the way physics works would make life impossible in a multiverse a vast number of universes are randomly created and some happen to favour life emerging there many inhospitable universes would also have been created but there would be no life there to observe their existence the quantum multiverse the quantum multiverse is another version in which our universe splits into alternative futures with every quantum event this is called many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics references the mechanistic paradigm also known as the newtonian paradigm assumes that things in the environment around humans are more like machines than like life it was more common in the th century this is a set of loosely related beliefs that affects all sciences in physics it presents atoms as made of particles in preference to say the wave theory of light in fact both the particle and wave view are required to explain everything light does but are rarely presented as equals many physics students graduate fully understanding the hydrogen bomb but having no clear idea of how musical instruments work in astrophysics it assumes that the universe is like clockwork and works on its own without our choice making any difference this fits relativity but is not easy to combine with quantum mechanics in cosmology it accepts models of our universe more easily if reject the continuous creation of matter energy or any new other universes in chemistry it assumes that molecules are like building blocks and have no unpredictable or strange and unique effects when combined this is the basic assumption of mechanosynthesis which some scientists think will create a molecular assembler in biology it assumes that everything about life all of biochemistry is predictable from chemistry and physics believers tend to regard ecology and psychology as less scientific than physics chemistry and biology believers may reject ideas like psychoneuroimmunology gaia philosophy or fecund universes for no scientific reason simply because these theories assume higher level phenomena sometimes drive lower levels greedy reductionism may be more likely among believers in mechanistic ideas for instance they may want to always see things as made of smaller even invisible parts that no one can see or prove is real like in string theory for this reason when they work in psychology they may prefer theories like behaviorism that deny free will and try to explain human behaviour as a function of biology the philosophy of mathematics of most believers is a form of platonism this assumes there is a perfect or ideal form that theories only approximate this lets them explain inaccuracies in mechanistic theories as being due to an imperfection in human ability to reason instead of imperfections in math itself believers in this paradigm sometimes say that those who do not believe in it are following a cognitive paradigm but almost no one uses this term since it is redundant cognitive science is already accepted as the most basic idea in the philosophy of science but mechanists reject some of the ideas of cognitive scientists like cognitive science of mathematics mechanistic thinking also assumes that philosophy of perception is much less important than cognitive scientists say it is that humans and their beliefs and equipment do not generally add a lot of bias to a scientific theory thomas kuhn said otherwise that these things matter and that the major assumptions of science can shift drastically this he called a paradigm shift the shift from mechanistic to cognitive paradigm is an example of this later he used other words to describe the assumptions and beliefs like mind set but the word paradigm is still used some say it is much over used economics is often said to suffer from assumptions of the mechanistic paradigm sometimes those who believe in neoclassical economics and also in the mechanistic paradigm say they seek to unify physics and economics as if people and particles behaved as two examples of the same kind of thing technology is often easier to make if people accept a mechanistic paradigm but it may be harder to say why it does not work if one believes in these ideas for instance creating diagnostic trees might be easier if one works from experience not from an idea of how a technology should or must work a controversial idea is that mechanistic ideas are just an older idea called scholasticism with more mathematics both tried to work from what should or must be instead of what experiment seemed to show another controversial idea is that scientism belief in science as if it were a religion or ethical tradition comes from this paradigm most scientists who are mechanistic do not say they see science as a guide to ethics but try to keep them separate mediawiki is the name of the software that runs all of the wikimedia projects mediawiki was released in it is free server based software which is licensed under the gnu general public license gpl the software is licensed under the gpl this means it is free content or open source mediawiki is designed to be run on a large web server farm for a website that gets millions of hits per day mediawiki is a very powerful scalable software and a feature rich wiki implementation that uses php to process and display data stored in its mysql database pages use mediawiki s wikitext format so that users without knowledge of xhtml or css can edit them easily when a user submits an edit to a page mediawiki writes it to the database but without deleting the previous versions of the page thus allowing easy reverts in case of vandalism or spamming mediawiki can manage image and multimedia files too which are stored in the filesystem for large wikis with lots of users mediawiki supports caching and can be easily coupled with squid proxy server software all wikimedia projects run on mediawiki version usage because mediawiki is flexible many websites that want people to contribute information use mediawiki rather than other types of wiki software those operated by wikia are

mediawiki website some are from the mediawiki developers while others are from programmers from all around the world most extensions can be download from wikimedia s subversion repository however there are some other extensions that other people host themselves some extensions had been added to the main software along the development of mediawiki for example the makesysop extension is an extension to promote a user into an administrator or a bureaucrat there were a total of extensions as of october namespaces in the default installation of mediawiki the software has namespaces

face and the chin of some men is called a beard some men have a lot of hair and a big mustache and some have very little in the modern world many men shave part or all of their mustaches or cut their mustache so it does not get very long a chin beard with no mustache is called a goatee whilst a chin beard with a mustache is known as a van dyke mustache in united kingdom and commonwealth of nations is spelled moustache some animals such as walruses also have hair like this and people sometimes also call this hair a mustache a mile is a unit of length there are many different kinds of mile but mile on its own usually means the statute mile statute mile in the us and the uk the word mile usually means the statute mile feet yard chain furlong mile kilometres nautical mile the nautical mile is used for sea or air travel the nautical mile was originally defined as one minute of arc along a line of longitude of the earth there are minutes of arc in one degree or arc so there were nautical miles from the north pole to the south pole now the nautical mile is defined as metres nautical mile metres by definition feet statute miles the speed of a ship that travels one nautical mile in one hour is called one knot roman mile the mile was first used by the romans it comes from the latin phrase mille passus plural milia passuum this means one thousand paces a pace is the distance each foot moves when taking one step roman mile roman paces by definition metres feet other miles different miles have been used throughout history in various parts of the world in norway and sweden for example a mil is a unit of length which is equal to kilometres margarine margarine is an artificial butter it can be made from vegetable oil or animal fat it may also contain skimmed milk salt and emulsifiers margarine is used in many baked products it contains less fat than butter so is often chosen instead of it there are also low fat margarines which contain even less fat however many types of margarine contain trans fats which are unhealthy and can cause heart disease other vegetables fats like olive oil are a better choice for cooking the milky way is our home galaxy it contains over billion stars including our sun the milky way has a diameter of about light years and is a barred spiral galaxy the idea that the milky way is made of stars goes back to the ancient greek philosopher democritus the milky way has three main parts a disk in which the solar system resides a bulge at the core and an all encompassing halo this galaxy belongs to the local group of three large galaxies and over smaller galaxies the milky way is one of the largest galaxies in the group second to the andromeda galaxy milky way s closest neighbour is canis major dwarf which is about light years away from the earth the andromeda galaxy moves towards the milky way galaxy and will meet it in about billion years andromeda galaxy moves with a speed of about kilometres per minute size the stellar disk of the milky way galaxy is approximately light years km in diameter and is considered to be on average about light years thick it is estimated to contain at least billion stars and possibly up to billion stars the figure depends on the number of very low mass or dwarf stars which are hard to detect especially more than light years from our sun therefore present estimates of the total number are uncertain this can be compared to the one trillion stars of the neighbouring andromeda galaxy the stellar disc of the milky way does not have a sharp edge a radius beyond which there are no stars rather the number of stars drops smoothly with distance from the centre of the galaxy beyond a radius of about light years the number of stars drops much faster for reasons that are not understood extending beyond the stellar disk is a much thicker disk of gas recent observations indicate that the gaseous disk of the milky way has a thickness of around light years twice the previously accepted value as a guide to the relative physical scale of the milky way if the solar system out to the orbit of pluto were reduced to the size of a us quarter about an inch or mm in diameter the milky way would have a diameter of kilometers at kilometers per second it takes the solar system about million years to complete one orbit of the galaxy a galactic year the galactic halo extends outward but is limited in size by the orbits of two milky way satellites the large and the small magellanic clouds whose closest approach is at about light years at this distance or beyond the orbits of most halo objects would be disrupted by the magellanic clouds and the objects would likely be ejected from the vicinity of the milky way galactic center observed spiral structure of the milky way galaxy the arrow points the direction of the solar system s motion relative to the spiral arms the milky way s spiral arms our sun is in the orion cygnus arm the galactic disc which bulges outward at the galactic center has a diameter of light years the exact distance from the sun to the galactic center is debated the latest estimates give distances to the galactic center of light years movement of material around the galactic center shows that it has a compact object of very large mass the intense radio source named sagittarius a thought to mark the center of the milky way is now confirmed to be a supermassive black hole most galaxies are believed to have a supermassive black hole at their center the nature of the galaxy s bar is also actively debated with estimates for its half length and orientation spanning from light years short or a long bar and degrees viewed from the andromeda galaxy it would be the brightest feature of our own galaxy myth in greek mythology zeus places his son the baby heracles whose mother was a mortal woman on hera s breast while she is sleeping so that the baby will drink her divine milk and become immortal however hera wakes up while she is breastfeeding the baby and realizes she is nursing a baby she does not know according to greek mythology she then pushes the baby away and a stream of her milk sprays the night sky making a faint band of light known as the milky way related pages galaxy local group list of galaxies references a beetle moving through the air movement or motion is the state of changing something s position that is changing where something is a flying bird or a walking person are moving because they change where they are from one place to another there are many kinds of science and math related to movement for example thanks to the work of scientists including galileo galilei and albert einstein we know that position and motion are relative this means that everything s position depends on where they exist in relation to other things for example a ball is feet away from a box feet away from a chair and a foot away from a table according to einstein the ball s position means how far the ball is from other things so by telling you how far the ball was from other things i told you its position an object s movement is also relative its movement depends on where it is in relation to other things and where it s going to in relation to other things there are many things involved in movement such as speed velocity acceleration gravity magnetic attraction and repulsion friction and inertia also work is needed to produce movement light moves at about kilometres per second or miles per second animal movement in animals movement is controlled by the nervous system especially the brain and spinal cord the muscles that control the eye are driven by the optic tectum in the midbrain all the voluntary muscles in the body are driven by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain spinal motor neurons are controlled by neural circuits of the spinal cord and by inputs from the brain the spinal circuits do many reflex responses and also do rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming the descending connections from the brain give more sophisticated control the brain has several motor areas that project directly to the spinal cord at the highest level is the primary motor cortex a strip of tissue at the back edge of the frontal lobe this tissue sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord through the pyramidal tract this allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements there are other brain areas which affect movement among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex basal ganglia and cerebellum major areas involved in controlling movement area location function ventral horn spinal cord contains motor neurons that directly activate muscles oculomotor nuclei midbrain contains motor neurons that directly activate the eye muscles cerebellum hindbrain calibrates precision and timing of movements basal ganglia forebrain action selection on the basis of motivation motor cortex frontal lobe direct cortical activation of spinal motor circuits premotor cortex frontal lobe groups elementary movements into coordinated patterns supplementary motor area frontal lobe sequences movements into temporal patterns prefrontal cortex frontal lobe planning and other executive functions in addition to all of the above the brain and spinal cord contain extensive circuitry to control the autonomic nervous system which works by secreting hormones and by modulating the smooth muscles of the gut the autonomic nervous system affects heart rate digestion respiration rate salivation perspiration urination and sexual arousal and several other processes most of its functions are not under direct voluntary control related pages newton s laws of motion transportation navigation references metaphor is a term for a figure of speech it does not use a word in its basic literal sense instead it uses a word in a kind of comparison we run and we also say rivers run we may run into trouble especially if we run up a bill at the bar so a metaphor uses words to make a picture in our mind it takes a word from its original context and uses it in another i beat him with a stick literal meaning of beat i beat him in an argument metaphorical meaning of beat metaphors are an essential part of language it is not possible to speak or write without them a simple example is the word run this has a basic meaning of moving quickly or go with quick steps on alternate feet never having both feet on the ground at the same time the concise oxford dictionary then gives other uses as a verb uses as a noun about uses in short phrases all of these are metaphors although we do not usually notice this we use metaphors to make indirect comparisons but without using like or as because that would be a simile a simile is a direct comparison jane is like a child a metaphor very often uses the verb to be love is war for example not love is like war that is a simile poetry includes much metaphor usually more than prose spam is an example that any email user knows about this word was originally a metaphor from spam a type of canned meat servers putting unwanted email into somebody s inbox was similar to waiters putting unwanted spam into food this was originally suggested by a monty python scene when we use a metaphor very often and we forget the old meaning or forget that the two meanings are connected this is a dead metaphor originally metaphor was a greek word for transfer it came from meta beyond and pherein carry so the word metaphor in english was a metaphor too today in greek metaphor is a trolley a thing that is pushed for carrying shopping or bags most metaphors are concepts see conceptual metaphor idioms use metaphors or are metaphors for example the english phrase to kick the bucket means to die simple metaphors description a simple metaphor has a single link between the subject and the metaphoric vehicle the vehicle thus has a single meaning which is transferred directly to the subject examples cool down cool temperature he was mad mad anger i ll chew on it chew think it was raining cats and dogs cats and dogs rain max was an angel angel lovely person in the simple metaphor the effort to understand what the author or speaker intends is relatively low and hence it may easily be used with a wider and less sophisticated audience complex metaphors description a complex metaphor happens where a simple metaphor is based on a secondary metaphoric element for example using a metaphor of light for understanding may be complexified by saying throwing light rather than shining light throwing is an extra metaphor for how light arrives examples that lends weight to the argument they stood alone frozen statues on the plain the ball happily danced into the net but at my back i always hear time s wingd chariot hurrying near and yonder all before us lie deserts of vast eternity from th century english poet andrew marvell s poem to his coy mistress compound metaphors description a compound metaphor is one where there are multiple parts in the metaphor that are used to snag the listener these parts may be enhancement words such as adverbs adjectives etc each part in the compound metaphor may be used to signify an additional item of meaning examples awake for morning in the bowl of night has flung the stone that puts the stars to flight an aged man is but a paltry thing a tattered coat upon a stick thick primal blind fog descended before his eyes the car screeched in hated anguish its flesh laid bare in the raucous collision compound metaphors are like a multiple punch hitting the listener repeatedly with metaphoric elements where the complex metaphor uses stacked layers to enhance the metaphor the compound metaphor uses sequential words the compound metaphor is also known as a loose metaphor live and dead metaphors a live metaphor is one which a reader notices a dead metaphor is one no one notices because it has become so common in the language examples two people walk off a tennis court someone asks the loser what happened he won literal truth he beat me obviously a dead metaphor he thrashed me this one is slightly alive the river runs dead and many variations on this theme electricity is a fluid nearly dead all our efforts are running into the sand live related pages trope references other websites a short history of metaphor rhetorical figures in sound structure of adenosine triphosphate atp a central intermediate in energy metabolism metabolism is the chemical reactions which keep us alive it happens in the cells of living organisms reactions catalyzed by enzymes allow organisms to grow reproduce maintain their structures and respond to their environments the word metabolism can also refer to digestion and the transport of substances into and between different cells metabolism is usually divided into two categories catabolism breaks down organic matter and harvests energy by way of cellular respiration anabolism uses energy to construct molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids the chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways or cycles like the krebs cycle one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical by a series of enzymes the metabolic system of an organism decides which substances it finds nutritious and which poisonous for example some prokaryotes use hydrogen sulfide as a nutrient yet this gas is poisonous to animals the speed of metabolism the metabolic rate influences how much food an organism will need and how it is able to get that food a striking feature of metabolism is the similarity of the basic metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species for example the set of carboxylic acids that are best known as the intermediates in the citric acid cycle are present in all known organisms being found in species as diverse as the unicellular bacterium escherichia coli and huge multicellular organisms like elephants these striking similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in the evolution of life and kept because of their efficiency related pages catabolism anabolism metabolic rate references a bausch and lomb light microscope electron microscope a microscope is a scientific instrument it makes small objects look larger this lets people see the small things people who use microscopes frequently in their jobs include doctors and scientists students in science classes such as biology or chemistry also use microscopes to study small things the earliest microscopes had only one lens and are called simple microscopes compound microscopes have at least two lenses in a compound microscope the lens closer to the eye is called the eyepiece the lens at the other end is called the objective the lenses multiply up so a x eyepiece and a x objective together give x magnification microscopes make things seem larger than they are to about times larger this is much stronger than a magnifying glass which works as a simple microscope types of microscopes there are many types of microscopes the most common kind of microscope is the compound light microscope in a compound light microscope the object is illuminated light is thrown on it the user looks at the image formed by the object light passes through two lenses and makes the image bigger the second most common kind are a few kinds of electron microscopes transmission electron microscopes tems fire cathode rays into the object being looked at this carries information about how the object looks into a magnetic lens the image is then magnified onto a television screen scanning electron microscopes also fire electrons at the object but in a single beam these lose their power when they strike the object and the loss of power results in something else being generated usually an x ray this is sensed and magnified onto a screen scanning tunneling microscopes were invented in a fluorescence microscope is a special kind of light microscope in the nobel prize in chemistry was awarded to eric betzig william moerner and stefan hell for the development of super resolved fluorescence microscopy the citation says it brings optical microscopy into the nanodimension references other websites microscopy information information relating to optics techniques and specimen preparation for teachers students amateur scientists scanning electron microscope the mass of an object is a measure of an object s resistance to acceleration sometimes also called inertia a mountain has typically more mass than a rock for instance mass should not be confused with the related but quite different concept of weight a large mass like the earth will attract a small mass like a human being with enough force to keep the human being from floating away mass attraction is another word for gravity a force that exists between all matter units of mass the unit of mass in the international system of units is the kilogram which is represented by the symbol kg fractions and multiples of this basic unit include the gram one thousandth of a kg symbol g and the tonne one thousand kg amongst many others in some fields or applications it is convenient to use different units to simplify the discussions or writings for instance atomic physicists deal with the tiny masses of individual atoms and measure them in atomic mass units jewelers normally work with small jewels and precious stones where masses are traditionally measured in carats which correspond to mg or g the masses of stars are very large and are sometimes expressed in units of solar masses traditional units are still in encountered in some countries imperial units such as the ounce or the pound were in widespread use within the british empire some of them are still popular in the united states which also uses units like the short ton pounds kg and the long ton pounds not to be confused with the metric tonne kg conservation of mass and relativity mass is an intrinsic property of the object it does not depend on its volume or position in space for instance for a long time at least since the works of antoine lavoisier in the second half of the eighteen century it has been known that the sum of the masses of objects that interact or of the chemicals that react remain conserved throughout these processes this remains an excellent approximation for everyday life and even most laboratory work however einstein has shown through his special theory of relativity that the mass m of an object moving at speed v with respect to an observer must be higher than the mass of the same object observed at rest m with respect to the observer the applicable formula is where c stands for the speed of light this change in mass is only important when the speed of the object with respect to the observer becomes a large fraction of c related pages mass versus weight center of mass gravity density body mass index advanced topics standard model higgs field mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system it is the closest planet to the sun it makes one trip around the sun once every days mercury is bright when it is visible from earth ranging from to in apparent magnitude it cannot be easily seen as it is usually too close to the sun because mercury is normally lost in the glare of the sun mercury can only be seen in the morning or evening twilight or during a solar eclipse less is known about mercury than about other planets of our solar system telescopes on the earth show only a small bright crescent and putting a satellite in orbit around it is difficult the first of two spacecraft to visit the planet was mariner which mapped only about of the planet s surface from to the second is the messenger spacecraft which finished mapping the planet in march mercury looks like earth s moon it has many craters and areas of smooth plains no moons around it and no atmosphere as we know it however mercury does have an extremely thin atmosphere known as an exosphere unlike earth s moon mercury has a large iron core which gives off a magnetic field about as strong as that of the earth it is a very dense planet due to the large size of its core surface temperatures can be anywhere from about to c to c f to f with the subsolar point being the hottest and the bottoms of craters near the poles being the coldest known sightings of mercury date back to at least the first millennium bc before the th century bc greek astronomers thought that mercury was two different objects one able to be seen only at sunrise which they called apollo the other that was only able to be seen at sunset which they called hermes the english name for the planet is from the romans who named it after the roman god mercury which they thought to be the same as the greek god hermes the symbol for mercury is based on hermes staff even though mercury is the closest planet to the sun it is not the warmest this is because it has no greenhouse effect so any heat that the sun gives to it quickly escapes into space the hottest planet is venus inside mercury mercury is one of four inner planets in the solar system and has a rocky body like the earth it is the smallest planet in the solar system with a radius of mercury is even smaller than some of the largest moons in the solar system such as ganymede and titan however it has a greater mass than the largest moons in the solar system mercury is made of about metallic and silicate material mercury s density is the second highest in the solar system at g cm only a little bit less than earth s alot of the planets

is the fourth planet from the sun in the solar system and the second smallest solid planet mars is a cold terrestrial planet with polar ice caps of frozen water and carbon dioxide it has the largest volcano in the solar system and some very large impact craters mars is named after the mythological roman god of war because it appears of red colour mars is sometimes called the red planet due to its colour space probes such as the viking program landers are the main tools for the exploration of mars appearance surface with rocks everywhere photographed by mars pathfinder mars is a terrestrial planet and made of rock the ground there is red because of iron oxide rust in the rocks and dust the planet s atmosphere is very thin it is mostly carbon dioxide with some argon and nitrogen and tiny amounts of other gases including oxygen the temperatures on mars are colder than on earth because it is farther away from the sun and has less air to keep heat in there is water ice and frozen carbon dioxide at the north and south poles mars does not have any liquid water on the surface now but signs of run off on the surface were probably caused by water the average thickness of the planet s crust is about km mi with a maximum thickness of km mi moons mars has two small moons called phobos and deimos physical geography rotation a martian day is called a sol and is a little longer than an earth day mars rotates in hours and minutes it rotates on a tilted axis just like the earth does so it has four different seasons of all the planets in the solar system the seasons of mars are the most earth like due to their similar axial tilt the lengths of the martian seasons are almost twice those of earth s as mars s greater distance from the sun leads to the martian year being almost two earth years long martian surface temperatures vary from lows of about at the winter polar caps to highs of up to in equatorial summer the wide range in temperatures is due mostly to the thin atmosphere which cannot store much solar heat the planet is also times as far from the sun as earth resulting in just of the amount of sunlight water opportunity showing a gray hematite concretion suggesting the past presence of liquid water a report says martian dark streaks on the surface were affected by water liquid water cannot exist on the surface of mars due to its low atmospheric pressure there s not enough air to hold it in except at the lowest elevations for short periods the two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of frozen water the amount of ice in the south polar ice cap if melted would be enough to cover the entire planet s surface meters deep a permafrost mantle stretches from the pole to latitudes of about geological evidence gathered by unmanned missions suggest that mars once had much liquid water on its surface in radar data revealed the presence of large quantities of water ice at the poles and at mid latitudes the mars rover spirit sampled chemical compounds containing water molecules in march the phoenix lander found water ice in shallow martian soil in july landforms seen on mars strongly suggest that liquid water at some time existed on the planet s surface huge areas of ground have been scraped and eroded polar caps mars has two permanent polar ice caps during a pole s winter it lies in continuous darkness chilling the surface and causing the deposition of of the atmosphere into slabs of co ice dry ice when the poles are again exposed to sunlight the frozen co sublimes turns to vapor creating enormous winds that sweep off the poles as fast as km h each season this moves large amounts of dust and water vapor giving rise to earth like frost and large cirrus clouds and dust storms clouds of water ice were photographed by the opportunity rover in the polar caps at both poles consist primarily of water ice atmosphere mars has a very thin atmosphere with barely any oxygen it is mostly carbon dioxide because there is an atmosphere however thin it is the sky does change colour when the sun rises and sets the dust in the martian atmosphere makes martian sunsets somewhat blue mars s atmosphere is too thin to protect mars from meteors which is why mars has so many craters meteorite craters after the formation of the planets all experienced the late heavy bombardment about of the surface of mars shows a record of impacts from that era much of the remaining surface is probably lying over the immense impact basins caused by those events there is evidence of an enormous impact basin in the northern hemisphere of mars spanning or roughly four times larger than the largest impact basin yet discovered this theory suggests that mars was struck by a pluto sized body about four billion years ago the event is thought to be the cause of the difference between the martian hemispheres it made the smooth borealis basin that covers of the planet some meteorites hit mars with so much force a few pieces of mars went flying into space even to earth rocks on earth are sometimes found which have chemicals that are exactly like the ones in martian rocks these rocks also look like they fell really quickly through the atmosphere so it is reasonable to think they came from mars geography mars is home to the highest known mountain in the solar system olympus mons olympus mons is about miles or kilometers high this is more than three times the height of earth s tallest mountain mount everest it is also home to valles marineris the third largest rift system canyon in the solar system km long observation of mars a coloured drawing of mars made in by the french astronomer trouvelot our records of watching and recording mars start with ancient egyptian astronomers in the nd millennium bc detailed observations of the location of mars were made by babylonian astronomers who developed methods using math to predict the future position of the planet the ancient greek philosophers and astronomers developed a model of the solar system with the earth at the center geocentric instead of the sun they used this model to explain the planet s motions indian and islamic astronomers estimated the size of mars and its distance from earth similar work was done by chinese astronomers in the th century nicholas copernicus proposed a model for the solar system in which the planets follow circular orbits about the sun this heliocentric model was the beginning of modern astronomy it was revised by johannes kepler who gave an elliptical orbit for mars which better fit the data from our observations the first observations of mars by telescope was by galileo galilei in within a century astronomers discovered distinct albedo features changes in brightness on the planet including the dark patch and polar ice caps they were able to find the planet s day rotation period and axial tilt better telescopes developed early in the th century allowed permanent martian albedo features to be mapped in detail the first crude map of mars was published in followed by better maps from onward astronomers mistakenly thought they had detected the spectroscopic mark of water in the martian atmosphere and the idea of life on mars became popular among the public yellow clouds on mars have been observed since the s which were windblown sand or dust during the s the range of martian surface temperature was measured it ranged from to oc the planetary atmosphere was found to be arid with only traces of oxygen and water in gerard kuiper showed that the thin martian atmosphere contained extensive carbon dioxide roughly double the quantity found in earth s atmosphere the first standard naming of mars surface features was set in by the international astronomical union since the s multiple robotic spacecraft and rovers have been sent to explore mars from orbit and the surface the planet has remained under observation by ground and space based instruments across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum visible light infrared and others the discovery of meteorites on earth that came from mars has allowed laboratory examination of the chemical conditions on the planet martian canals during the opposition italian astronomer giovanni schiaparelli used a telescope to help produce the first detailed map of mars what caught people s attention was that the maps had features he called canali these were later shown to be an optical illusion not real these canali were supposedly long straight lines on the surface of mars to which he gave names of famous rivers on earth his term canali was popularly mistranslated in english as canals and thought to be made by intelligent beings other astronomers thought they could see the canals too especially the american astronomer percival lowell who drew maps of an artificial network of canals on mars although these results were widely accepted they were contested greek astronomer eugne m antoniadi and english naturalist alfred russel wallace were against the idea wallace was extremely outspoken as bigger and better telescopes were used fewer long straight canali were observed during an observation in by flammarion with a telescope irregular patterns were observed but no canali were seen life on mars mars by viking in because mars is the one of the closest planets to earth in the solar system many have wondered if there is any kind of life on mars today we know that the kind of life if any would be some simple bacteria type organism meteorites nasa maintains a catalog of mars meteorites that is meteorites which originally came from mars these assets are highly valuable since they are the only physical samples available of mars studies at nasa s johnson space center show that at least three of the meteorites contain possible evidence of past life on mars in the form of microscopic structures resembling fossilized bacteria so called biomorphs although the scientific evidence collected is reliable and the rocks are correctly described what made the rocks look like they do is not clear to date scientists are still trying to agree if it really is evidence of simple life on mars over the past few decades scientists have agreed that when using meteorites from other planets found on earth or rocks brought back to earth various things are needed to be sure of life those things include did the rock comes from the right time and place on the planet for life to exist does the sample contain evidence of bacterial cells does it show fossils of some kind even if very tiny is there any evidence of biominerals minerals usually caused by living things is there any evidence of isotopes typical of life are the features part of the meteorite and not contamination from earth for people to agree on past life in a geologic sample most or all of these things must be met this has not happened yet but investigations are still in progress reexaminations of the biomorphs found in the three martian meteorites are underway the significance of water liquid water is necessary for life and metabolism so if water was present on mars the chances of life evolving is improved the viking orbiters found evidence of possible river valleys in many areas erosion and in the southern hemisphere branched streams since then rovers and orbiters have also looked closely and eventually proved water was on the surface at one time and is still found as ice in the polar ice caps and underground today so far scientists have not found life on mars either living or extinct several space probes have gone to mars to study it some have orbited gone around the planet and some have landed on it there are pictures of the surface of mars that were sent back to earth by the probes some people are interested in sending astronauts to visit mars they could do a better search but getting astronauts there would be difficult and expensive the astronauts would be in space for many years and it could be very dangerous because of radiation from the sun so far we have only sent unmanned probes the most recent probe to the planet is the mars science laboratory it landed on aeolis palus in gale crater on mars on august it brought with it a mobile explorer called curiosity it is the most advanced space probe ever curiosity has dug up martian soil and studied it in its laboratory it has found sulfur chlorine and water molecules popular culture some famous stories were written about this idea the writers used the name martians for intelligent beings from mars in h g wells wrote the war of the worlds a famous novel about martians attacking the earth in orson welles broadcast a radio version of this story in the united states and many people thought it was really happening and were very afraid

atoms are made blue oxygen atoms are made red and hydrogen atoms are made white to show the difference in reality atoms do not have a color a molecule is the smallest amount of a chemical substance that can exist if a molecule were split into smaller pieces it would be a different substance molecules are made up of atoms that are stuck together in a particular shape or form not all combinations of atoms are equally possible atoms make certain shapes in preference to others also they have different valency for example oxygen atoms always have two bonds with other atoms carbon atoms always have four bonds with other atoms and nitrogen atoms always have three bonds with other atoms in the kinetic theory of gases the term molecule is often used for any gaseous particle regardless of its composition according to this definition noble gas atoms are considered molecules as they are in fact monoatomic molecules in gases like air the molecules are just flying around in liquids like water the molecules are stuck together but they can still move in solids like sugar the molecules can only vibrate in the fourth state of matter known as plasma the atoms are ionized and cannot form molecules with a molecular formula you can write down the numbers of all atoms in a molecule for example the molecular formula of glucose is c h o that means that one molecule of glucose is made up of six carbon atoms twelve hydrogen atoms and six oxygen atoms bonding for a molecule to exist atoms have to stick together this happens when two atoms share electrons instead of circling just one atom the electron now circles around two this is called a covalent bond sometimes more than one electron is shared the more electrons are shared the stronger the bond gets and the stronger the atoms stick together bonds can also be broken apart since most bonds require energy to form they also give off energy when they are broken but before most bonds break the molecule has to be heated then the atoms start to move and when they move too much the bond breaks molecules that require less energy to break than they give off when broken are called fuels for example a candle will just sit there and nothing happens but when you use a match to light it it will burn for a long time the match brings the energy to break the first bonds which release enough energy to break the bonds below them until the candle has burned down there are also ionic bonds references other websites molecule of the month school of chemistry university of bristol antibody molecule the national health museum data book

a larger collective mosque is called a masjid jmi larger mosques offer more services to their community for many muslim people a mosque is more than a place of worship muslims worship study and discuss islam and do many other things in a mosque and its compounds in the united kingdom many mosques are used as community centres they are also used to teach about islam religious festivals and gatherings are held in mosques weddings are one example mosques have rules to control what people do inside one of these rules is that it is considered rude to disturb another person who is worshipping many mosques are known for their islamic architecture the earliest mosques opened in th century were open air spaces they are the quba mosque and masjid al nabawi later mosques were buildings that were specially designed nowadays mosques are in every continent except antarctica architecture the jami ul alfar mosque in colombo sri lanka has striking moorish and colonial architecture with a candy striped facade many mosques are famous works of architecture they are often built in a style that has stayed the same for many centuries many mosques have prayer halls domes and minarets they may also have a courtyard mosques are often built with patterned walls mosques were first built on the arabian peninsula the muslims who built them used old architectural styles they also combined these styles in new ways a major influence was the palaces built during the parthian and sassanid dynasties of persia the sarvestan palace from the sassanid era is a good example of this it has an arched entrance and a central dome these features already existed in persia before islam after the arab invasion of persia the new style with its sassanid influence was used for the new islamic world many forms of mosques have developed in different regions of the islamic world important mosque types include the early abbasid mosques t type mosques and the central dome mosques of anatolia in the th century many countries that grew rich from oil paid for the building of many new mosques the rulers of these countries often hired leading architects to design these mosques they included non muslims arab plan al azhar mosque in cairo egypt has a hypostyle hall many early mosques have a square or rectangular plan they also have a prayer hall and an enclosed courtyard this is known as arab plan the first mosques of this type were built during the umayyad dynasty the flat roof of the prayer hall was supported by columns many rows of columns were needed to support such roofs this is called hypostyle architecture one of the most famous hypostyle mosques is the mezquita de crdoba in spain it is supported by over columns in the warm mediterranean and middle eastern climates the courtyard served to hold the large number of worshippers during friday prayers often hypostyle mosques have outer arcades they allow the visitors to enjoy the shade arab plan mosques were built mostly during the umayyad and abbasid dynasties the arab plan was very simple which did not allow for much further development this caused that style of mosque to fall out of favour central dome the ottomans began building central dome mosques in the fifteenth century these mosques have a large dome centered over the prayer hall there may also be smaller domes which are off center over the prayer hall or the rest of the mosque this style was heavily influenced by the byzantine religious architecture with its use of central domes iwan iwan mosques are famous for their domed rooms and iwans iwans are spaces with an arched roof they have an opening at one end one or more iwans face a central courtyard that serves as the prayer hall the style borrows from pre islamic iranian architecture most mosques with this style are in iran parts of mosques minarets the great mosque in aleppo syria the tower like structure is the minaret most mosques have minarets minarets are tall towers usually they are at one of the corners of the mosque the top of the minaret is the highest point in the mosque and usually the highest point in the area around the mosque the tallest minaret in the world is in the hassan ii mosque in casablanca morocco the first mosques had no minarets the most conservative islamic groups like wahhabis still avoid building minarets they see them as simply a fancy decoration and unnecessary the first minaret was built in in basra during the reign of the umayyad caliph muawiyah i muawiyah encouraged the building of minarets as they were supposed to be the same as bell towers on christian churches because of this mosque architects used the shape of the bell tower for their minarets both the minaret and the bell tower serve the same purpose to call the faithful to prayer before the five required daily prayers a muezzin calls the worshippers to prayer from the minaret in many countries like singapore where muslims are not the majority mosques are stopped from loudly playing the call to prayer the main problem is the use of electronic amplification of the call which is now widely used by mosques domes the domes of the khatem al anbiyaa mosque in beirut lebanon the domes were often placed directly above the main prayer hall they represent the universe that allah created at first these domes were small they only took up a small part of the roof near the mihrab later they took the whole roof above the prayer hall domes normally have the shape of a hemisphere the mughals in india popularized onion shaped domes in south asia and persia some mosques have several domes as well as the main large dome the other domes are often smaller domes would help the imam be heard as the sound waves would bounce in and then out of the dome making the voice louder prayer hall all mosques have a prayer hall which is also called musalla normally there is no furniture in it except for prayer mats or rugs these are necessary as islamic prayer is usually done kneeling some mosques have arabic calligraphy and qur anic verses on the walls to help worshipers focus on the beauty of islam and its holiest book the qur an as well as for decoration the qiblah wall is usually at the other side of the entrance to the prayer hall this wall is specially decorated in a properly sited mosque it will be set perpendicular to a line leading to mecca people pray in rows parallel to the qiblah wall they arrange themselves so they face mecca in the qiblah wall usually at its center is the mihrab a niche or depression showing the direction of mecca the mihrab serves as the place where the imam leads the five daily prayers a simple mosque in the australian outback is different from the grand designs of older islamic communities bourke cemetery new south wales washing wudhu all people must wash themselves before they pray mosques often have fountains or other facilities for washing in their entrances or courtyards so that people can perform the washing ritual before prayer at very small mosques worshippers may use restrooms for their ritual washing or wu du in traditional mosques there is often a building specially for washing this is often in the center of the courtyard in the prayer halls people must not wear shoes for much the same reason modern features modern mosques should appeal to the community they serve for this reason other facilities may also be available at the mosque like health clinics libraries and sports halls the inside of mosques file inside shah faisal mosque inside the shah faisal mosque in islamabad pakistan file cairo sulayman pasha inside the sulayman pasha mosque in cairo egypt file nasr ol molk mosque inside colorful the nasr ol molk mosque in shiraz iran there may be decorative tiles plaster or coloured mosaics on the walls there are no pictures or statues religious functions prayers muslims performing salat at the umayyad mosque adult muslims are expected to pray five times a day most mosques have formal prayers for each of these times if performing the prayer is difficult for example for ill people then exceptions are made mosques also hold a special prayer service called jumuah this is done once a week it is a form of sabbath and replaces the friday prayers at the mosque daily prayers can be done anywhere however muslims are expected to do their friday prayer at the mosque when a muslim dies a funeral prayer is normally held it is held outdoors in a courtyard or square close to the mosque the prayers have all the worshippers present including the imam taking part during eclipses mosques will host special prayers called eclipse prayers there are two large holidays eids in the islamic calendar during these days there are special prayers at mosques in the morning larger mosques will normally hold them for their own communities as well as the people from smaller local mosques mosques especially those in countries where muslims are the majority will also host eid prayers outside in courtyards or town squares a mosque in afghanistan ramadan events there are many events in ramadan islam s holiest month during ramadan muslims must fast during the day mosques organise iftar dinners after sunset these are done after the fourth required prayer of the day part of the food is given by members of the community which creates nightly potluck dinners the community contribution to these dinners is required for this reason mosques with smaller communities may not be able to hold the iftar dinners daily some mosques will also hold meals in the morning before dawn mosques will often invite poorer members of the community to these meals islam sees giving charity during ramadan as good acts larger mosques sometimes offer special optional prayers they are done after the last required prayer of the day during each night of prayers one member of the community who has memorized the entire qur an will recite a part of the book it can last for up to two hours sometimes several such people not necessarily of the local community take turns to do this during the last ten days of ramadan larger mosques will host all night programs to observe laylat al qadr it is the night muslims believe that the islamic prophet muhammad first received qur anic revelations on that night between sunset and sunrise mosques employ speakers to teach the worshipers about islam mosques or the community usually provide meals at times through the night al abbs mosque in karbala iraq is visited by millions of shia pilgrims each year political functions mosque in cuiab brazil during the late twentieth century more and more mosques have been used for political purposes modern day mosques in the western world want to educate good citizens the details differ greatly from mosque to mosque and from country to country advocacy countries with small muslim populations use mosques as a way to support civic participation they are more likely to do this than muslim majority countries of the greater middle east american mosques host voter registration and civic participation drives in the united states muslims are often immigrants or the children of immigrants mosques want to interest these people for politics they also want to keep them informed about issues that concern the muslim community people who attend the services at the mosque regularly are more likely to take part in protests to sign petitions and to involve themselves in political matters a link between political views and mosque attendance can still be seen in other parts of the world after the al askari mosque bombing in february imams and other islamic leaders used mosques and friday prayers to call for calm and peace during the widespread violence beginning in the late twentieth century and continuing into the early twenty first century a small number of mosques have also become a base for extremist imams to support terrorism and extreme islamic ideals finsbury park mosque in london is a mosque that has been used in this manner social conflict like other places of worship mosques can be at the center of social conflicts babri mosque was the centre of such a conflict up until the early s when it was demolished before a solution could be found the mosque was destroyed by about hindus it took place on december the mosque was built by babur to mark the birthplace of ram it was believed to be on a site of an earlier hindu temple the conflict over the mosque was directly linked to rioting in bombay present day mumbai as well as bombings in that killed people in february a bombing seriously damaged iraq s al askari mosque this increased the existing tensions the conflict between two muslim groups in iraq had already led to other bombings however mosque bombings are not limited to iraq in june a suicide bomber killed at least people at an afghan mosque in april there were two explosions at india s jama masjid after the september attacks several american mosques were targets of attacks these ranged from simple vandalism to arson the jewish defense league was suspected of plotting to bomb the king fahd mosque in culver city california there were similar attacks in the united kingdom after the july london bombings outside the western world in june the hassan bek mosque was the target of attacks the attacks involved hundreds of israelis angry at arabs for a previous attack saudi influence saudi involvement in building mosques around the world only goes back to the s in the s the saudi arabian government began to pay for the building of mosques in countries around the world an estimated us billion has been spent by the saudi arabian government for mosques and islamic schools in foreign countries ain al yaqeen a saudi newspaper reported in that saudi money may have helped to build as many as mosques and other islamic centers saudi citizens have also given a lot of money to mosques in the islamic world especially in countries where they see muslims as poor and oppressed following the fall of the soviet union in mosques in afghanistan received money from saudi citizens the king fahd mosque in culver city california and the islamic cultural center of italy in rome are two of saudi arabia s largest investments in foreign mosques as former saudi king fahd bin abdul aziz al saud gave us million and us million to the two mosques respectively rules and behaviour in mosques baitul mukarram dhaka the national mosque of bangladesh the structure resembles the kaaba in mecca in a mosque people should keep focused on worshiping allah for this reason there are a number of rules about the correct behaviour in a mosque some of these rules are the same all over the world such as no shoes should be worn in the prayer hall other rules are different from mosque to mosque prayer leader it is generally seen as good to have someone who leads the prayers though this is not strictly necessary the person who usually leads the prayers is called imam he must be a free and honest man he should also be an authority when it comes to answering questions on religion in mosques that were built or that are kept up by the government the imam is selected by the ruler in private mosques the community selects the imam through majority voting interior of the mezquita a hypostyle former mosque with columns arranged in grid pattern in crdoba spain only men may lead prayers for men women are allowed to lead prayers for congregations where there are only women attending a mosque in addition to washing there are other rules that also apply to those who enter the mosque even if they do not wish to pray there it is forbidden to wear shoes in the carpeted area of the prayer hall some mosques also do not allow wearing shoes in other parts even though these may not be devoted to praying islam requires that its believers wear clothes that show modesty as a result both men and women must follow this rule when they attend a mosque though mosques may not always enforce the rules men are supposed to come to the mosque wearing loose and clean clothes that do not show the shape of the body similarly women who come to the mosque are expected to wear loose clothing shirts pants that cover to the wrists and ankles and cover their heads such as with a hijab many muslims regardless of their ethnic background wear middle eastern clothing associated with arabic islam to special occasions and prayers at mosques mosques are places of worship for this reason those inside the mosque should be respectful to those who are praying loud talking or discussion of topics that could be disrespectful is forbidden in areas where people are praying it is also considered as rude to walk in front of muslims in prayer or otherwise disturb them men and women pray in different parts muslims praying in the male section of a mosque in srinagar jammu and kashmir india islamic law requires men and women to be separated in the prayer hall ideally women should pray behind men the second caliph umar at one time stopped women from attending mosques especially at night because he feared they may be teased by males so he made them to pray at home sometimes a special part of the mosque was railed off for women for example the governor of mecca in had ropes tied between the columns to make a separate place for women many mosques today will put the women behind a barrier or partition or in another room mosques in south and southeast asia put men and women in separate rooms as the divisions were built into them centuries ago in nearly two thirds of american mosques women pray behind partitions or in separate areas not in the main prayer hall some mosques do not admit women at all although there are sections only for women and children the grand mosque in mecca is desegregated non muslims in mosques a few scholars of islamic law believe that non muslims may be allowed into mosques as long as they do not sleep or eat there followers of the maliki school of islamic jurisprudence disagree they say that non muslims may not be allowed into mosques at all different countries have different opinions on the question nearly all the mosques in the arabian peninsula as well as morocco do not allow non muslims the hassan ii mosque in casablanca is one of only two mosques in morocco currently open to non muslims in modern day saudi arabia the grand mosque and all of mecca are open only to muslims likewise the masjid al nabawi and the city of medina that surrounds it are also off limits to those who do not practice islam for mosques in other areas it has most commonly been taken that non muslims may only enter mosques if granted permission to do so by muslims and if they have a proper reason in modern turkey non muslim tourists are allowed to enter any mosque but must obey the rules of decorum visiting a mosque is allowed only between prayers visitors must wear long trousers and take off their shoes women must cover their heads no photos no loud talk is allowed no references to other religions are allowed no crosses on necklaces no cross gestures etc however there are also many other places in the west as well as the islamic world where non muslims are welcome to enter mosques most mosques in the united states for example report receiving non muslim visitors every month many mosques throughout the united states welcome non muslims as a sign of openness to the rest of the community and to encourage conversions to islam dogs dogs are usually banned from entering mosques but on september the muslim law council uk made special ruling called a fatwa which granted a blind muslim permission to take his guide dog into the mosque mosques as hostels it is common for a smaller mosque to serve as a hostel for muslims on haj pilgrimage to mecca sometimes mosques are used for refugees or as temporary homes for homeless people obligations to neighbours in islam are very strict and specific in the qur an mohammed pbuh said that a person who helps others in the hour of need and who helps the oppressed that person god will help on the day of travail agony there are other commands such as helping the poor and being nice to people an important part of being muslim or just being part of the mosque is taking care of people who need help a mosque is a social as well as a religious group a madrassa is a little different from a mosque a madrassa focuses on teaching islam usually to children and young people mosques in spain the mezquita de crdoba was a mosque today it is the cathedral of cordoba when spain was under muslim control some of the most beautiful buildings were mosques after spain was under christian control however the christians did not tear down the mosques they simply put a crucifix in them to make them into churches these mosques influenced the renaissance architecture way of building in europe references mammals are a group of vertebrate animals which form the class mammalia they have fur or hair and a very precise kind of temperature regulation with the exception of the monotremes all mammals bear live young they also produce milk for the young parental care of the young is universal among mammals and it is essential because live birth limits the number of offspring main characteristics reproductive cycle most marsupial and eutherian mammals have a reproductive cycle known as the oestrous cycle u s estrous cycle females are sexually active only during the oestrous stage when they are on heat for a few days each month if an ovum is not fertilized the endometrium uterus lining is resorbed oestrus cycles may occur once or twice a year or many times a year each group of mammals has its own frequency humans and primates are quite different they have a menstrual cycle in this case females are sexually receptive at any time but only fertile when an ovum is released from an ovary in this case the endometrium if not needed for an fertilised egg is discarded the endometrium is shed and takes with it a certain amount of blood in this system eggs are released from the ovaries mostly in the middle of the cycle away from the menstrual period this ovulation is concealed meaning it is not obvious when it occurs this process so it is thought tends to keep the male and female together which is unusual in mammals with the oestrous cycle skeleton one diagnostic feature is the lower jaw which unlike earlier forms is composed of a single bone the dentary this is one feature which can be seen in fossils or at least those which are complete enough to have the lower jaw mammals have three little bones in their inner ear the ear ossicles the ear ossicles are bones which were long ago part of the lower jaw in early proto mammals there are quite a number of other features particularly in the skull and limbs so that it is usually possible identify and describe a mammal from its skeleton alone neocortex and behavior another diagnostic feature is the neocortex of the brain which no other vertebrate has this is involved in the kind of flexible behavior and learning typical of mammals reptiles and birds have much of their behavior controlled by inherited behavior chains which roughly translates as instincts almost all animals can do some learning but mammals do far more than other vertebrates their behavior is much more flexible than lizards for example and that is made possible by their neocortex other things in the life of mammals seem to be connected with this flexibility and learning play is a kind of early learning period in which according to one theory mammals develop skills which they will need in life all mammalian young play and this is very obvious in the more intelligent mammals primates cats the emotions of mammals are very noticeable and rather similar to ours it is possible and quite common for humans to have a friendly relationship with another mammal it is quite impossible for a human to have any kind of relationship with a snake or a gecko for example this is because the reptile simply does not have the same basic emotions as a human other items there are about characters which are typical of mammals and some of the most important are discussed above a few more examples will make it clear that mammals are very different from reptiles and birds sweat glands tooth replacement two sets and no continuous replacement enamel on the tooth surface reptile teeth all alike mammal teeth follow a pattern incisors canines premolars and molars occipital condyles two knobs at the base of the skull fit into the topmost neck vertebra most tetrapods in contrast have only one such knob outlet for food waste separate from urinogenital outlet reptiles and birds have a common cloaca at the rear mammals excrete urea reptiles and birds excrete uric acid colour vision is defective or absent in most mammals primates are an exception in reptiles and birds the blood vessel which carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle of the heart lies on the right side of the body but in mammals it lies on the left side there are many features of the skeleton that mammals share their neck almost always has seven vertebrae no matter how long it is their lower jaw is made of just a single bone on each side the dentary their inner ear has three tiny bones the ossicles malleus incus and stapes in the language of cladistics these unique characters are apomorphies which prove that mammals are a clade descended from a common ancestor main groups almost all mammal species give birth to live young there are only two mammals that lay eggs called monotremes the duck billed platypus ornithorhynchus and the spiny anteater echidna with four species all are confined to australia and new guinea and are the sole survivors of an earlier group of mammals however like other mammals they feed milk to their young and protect and look after them other mammals are divided into the marsupials and the eutheria the placental mammals marsupials are mammals with pouches to carry young in like the kangaroo modes of life in terms of number of species mammals with species are not the most successful vertebrates birds with about species have nearly twice as many and reptiles have just as many as birds fish have even more species there are species of fish of which nearly are bony fish despite this many zoologists do regard mammals as a successful group of animals one reason is that they are successful in all habitats on earth in the air in the water in forests in the colder regions of the world and above all on grasslands where they are outstandingly successful in the air the bats chiroptera are the mammalian order with the most species they own the nighttime since birds are largely diurnal daytime animals bats are hugely successful mostly as nighttime predators of insects seagoing mammals the cetacea and the pinnipeds are very successful and significant predators this includes the whales seals walrus dolphins and others the terrestrial mammals are fewer in number of species than lizards but they are huge in individual numbers and far more important in the life of the terrestrial biomes their ability to move from place to place and adapt has made them a most effective group many mammals live in cold places these mammals have thick hair or blubber to keep them warm others may live in rainforests on land the rodents rats mice are hugely successful more common in numbers than any other mammals large mammals on land have been hunted to extinction in some parts of the world but the ones which remain are now better protected last but certainly not least are the primates their natural habitat with few exceptions are the forests most live in the trees with hands that grasp good colour vision and intelligence in the pliocene period some moved out onto the savannahs as grassland replaced forests mankind is the result of this shift into the savannahs taxonomy the evolutionary relationships among land vertebrates is as follows tetrapoda land vertebrates amphibia lay eggs in water amniota lay cleidoic eggs sauropsida all true reptiles synapsida all mammal like amniotes pelycosauria therapsida in particular the cynodontia mammalia bear live young milk raise their young etc this sort of classification is not traditional but it does reflect our knowledge of palaeontology and evolution standardized textbook classification a somewhat standardized classification system has been adopted by most current mammalogy classroom textbooks it is based on living animals the following taxonomy of extant and recently extinct mammals is from vaughan et al class mammalia subclass prototheria monotremes platypuses and echidnas subclass theria live bearing mammals infraclass metatheria marsupials infraclass eutheria placentals list of living orders over of mammal species are in the orders rodentia blue chiroptera red soricomorpha yellow and primates green mammals can be divided in a number of orders monotremes monotremata marsupials marsupialia eutheria superorder xenarthra order pilosa order cingulata superorder afrotheria order proboscidea superorder laurasiatheria insectivora no longer used order eulipotyphla order chiroptera order carnivora order perissodactyla order artiodactyla order cetacea superorder euarchontoglires order rodentia order lagomorpha order primates debate on the meaning of mammalia because two quite different dates are given in the taxobox an explanation is needed rowe defines mammals as the taxon originating with the most recent common ancestor of extant living monotremata and theria that puts the emphasis heavily on living mammals where as rowe points out the database of characters is extensive kemp explains the problem with that approach if the definition of a mammal is based rigorously upon possession of all the characters of living mammals then some fossil forms that are extremely mammalian in anatomy are excluded an altogether different perspective on defining mammalia is based on traditional palaeobiological practice an arbitrary decision is made about which characters to select as defining characters characters deemed appropriate are those reflecting the fundamental mammalian biology the essence of mammalian life is to be found in their endothermic temperature physiology greatly enlarged brain dentition capable of chewing food highly agile energetic locomotion and so on the organisms that achieved this grade of overall organisation are deemed to be mammalia around the end of the triassic period about mya a number of fossils are found of very small animals that have most of the skeletal characters of modern mammals this difference in outlook explains the difference in the

taxonomy references for the book in the bible see numbers bible a sudoku puzzle a number is a concept from mathematics used to count or measure depending on the field of mathematics where numbers are used there are different definitions people use symbols to represent numbers they call them numerals common places where numerals are used are for labeling as in telephone numbers for ordering as in serial numbers or to put a unique identifier as in an isbn a unique number that can identify a book cardinal numbers are used to measure how many items are in a set a b c has size ordinal numbers are used to specify a certain element in a set or sequence first second third numbers are also used for other things besides counting numbers are used when things are measured numbers are used to study how the world works mathematics is a way to use numbers to learn about the world and make things the study of the rules of the natural world is called science the work that uses numbers to make things is called engineering numbering methods numbers for people there are different ways of giving symbols to numbers these methods are called number systems the most common number system that people use is the base ten number system the base ten number system is also called the decimal number system the base ten number system is common because people have ten fingers and ten toes there are different symbols and used in the base ten number system these ten symbols are called digits a symbol for a number is made up of these ten digits the position of the digits shows how big the number is for example the number in the decimal number system really means times plus and means times a hundred plus times plus times numbers for machines another number system is more common for machines the machine number system is called the binary number system the binary number system is also called the base two number system there are two different symbols and used in the base two number system these two symbols are called bits a symbol for a binary number is made up of these two bit symbols the position of the bit symbols shows how big the number is for example the number in the binary number system really means times plus and means times four plus times two plus times the binary number is the same as the decimal number the binary number is the same as the decimal number names of numbers english has special names for some of the numbers in the decimal number system that are powers of ten all of these power of ten numbers in the decimal number system use just the symbol and the symbol for example ten tens is the same as ten times ten or one hundred in symbols this is also ten hundreds is the same as ten times one hundred or one thousand in symbols this is some other power of ten numbers also have special names one ten one hundred one thousand one million when dealing with larger numbers than this there are two different ways of naming the numbers in english under the long scale a new name is given every time the number is a million times larger than the last named number it is also called the british standard this scale used to be common in britain but is not often used in english speaking countries today it is still used in some other european nations another scale is the short scale under which a new name is given every time a number is a thousand times larger than the last named number this scale is a lot more common in most english speaking nations today one billion short scale one milliard long scale one trillion short scale one billion long scale one quadrillion short scale one billiard long scale types of numbers natural numbers natural numbers are the numbers which we normally use for counting etc some people say that is a natural number too another name for these numbers is positive numbers these numbers are sometimes written as to show that they are different from the negative numbers but not all positive numbers are natural for example is positive but not natural if is called a natural number then the natural numbers are the same as the whole numbers if is not called a natural number then the natural numbers are the same as the counting numbers so if the words natural numbers are not used then there will be less confusion about whether zero is included or not but unfortunately some say that zero is not a whole number either and some say whole numbers can be negative positive integers and non negative integers are another way to include zero or exclude zero but only if people know those words negative numbers negative numbers are numbers less than zero one way to think of negative numbers is using a number line we call one point on this line zero then we will label write the name of every position on the line by how far to the right of the zero point it is for example the point one is one centimeter to the right the point two is two centimeters to the right now think about a point which is one centimeter to the left of the zero point we cannot call this point one as there is already a point called one we therefore call this point minus as it is one centimeter away but in the opposite direction a drawing of a number line is below number line to all the normal operations of mathematics can be done with negative numbers if people add a negative number to another this is the same as taking away the positive number with the same numerals for example is the same as and equals if they take away a negative number from another this is the same as adding the positive number with the same numerals for example is the same as and equals if they multiply two negative numbers together they get a positive number for example times is if they multiply a negative number by a positive number or multiply a positive number by a negative number they get a negative result for example times is as finding the square root of a negative number is impossible as negative times negative equals possitve we simbolise the square root of a negative number as i integers integers are all the natural numbers all their opposites and the number zero decimal numbers and fractions are not integers rational numbers rational numbers are numbers which can be written as fractions this means that they can be written as a divided by b where the numbers a and b are integers and b is not equal to some rational numbers such as need a finite number of digits after the decimal point to write them in decimal form the number one tenth is written in decimal form as numbers written with a finite decimal form are rational some rational numbers such as need an infinite number of digits after the decimal point to write them in decimal form there is a repeating pattern to the digits following the decimal point the number one eleventh is written in decimal form as a percentage could be called a rational number because a percentage like can be written as the fraction it can also be written as the decimal sometimes a ratio is considered as a rational number irrational numbers irrational numbers are numbers which cannot be written as a fraction but do not have imaginary parts explained later is irrational irrational numbers often occur in geometry for instance if we have a square which has sides of meter the distance between opposite corners is the square root of two which equals this is an irrational number mathematicians have proved that the square root of every natural number is either an integer or an irrational number one well known irrational number is pi this is the circumference distance around of a circle divided by its diameter distance across this number is the same for every circle the number pi is approximately an irrational number cannot be fully written down in decimal form it would have an infinite number of digits after the decimal point unlike these digits would not repeat forever real numbers real numbers is a name for all the sets of numbers listed above the rational numbers including integers the irrational numbers this is all numbers that do not involve imaginary numbers imaginary numbers imaginary numbers are formed by real numbers multiplied by the number i this number is the square root of minus one there is no number in the real numbers which when squared makes the number therefore mathematicians invented a number they called this number i or the imaginary unit imaginary numbers operate under the same rules as real numbers the sum of two imaginary numbers is found by pulling out factoring out the i for example i i i i the difference of two imaginary numbers is found similarly for example i i i i when multiplying two imaginary numbers remember that i i i is for example i i i i imaginary numbers were called imaginary because when they were first found many mathematicians did not think they existed the person who discovered imaginary numbers was gerolamo cardano in the s the first to use the words imaginary number was ren descartes the first people to use these numbers were leonard euler and carl friedrich gauss both lived in the th century complex numbers complex numbers are numbers which have two parts a real part and an imaginary part every type of number written above is also a complex number complex numbers are a more general form of numbers the complex numbers can be drawn on a number plane this is composed of a real number line and an imaginary number line i i i i i i i i i all of normal mathematics can be done with complex numbers to add two complex numbers add the real and imaginary parts separately for example i i i i to subtract one complex number from another subtract the real and imaginary parts separately for example i i i i to multiply two complex numbers is complicated it is easiest to describe in general terms with two complex numbers a b i and c d i for example i i i i i transcendental numbers a real or complex number is called a transcendental number if it can not be obtained as a result of an algebraic equation with integer coefficients proving that a certain number is transcendental can be extremely difficult each transcendental number is also an irrational number the first people to see that there were transcendental numbers were gottfried wilhelm leibniz and leonhard euler the first to actually prove there were transcendental numbers was joseph liouville he did this in well known transcendental numbers e ea for algebraic a notes november nov is the th and penultimate second last month of the year in the gregorian calendar coming between october and december it has

name of a kind of animal ryan is a name of a person usually a male julia is a common female name the word name can also be used as a verb to name something is to give it a name people s names in many cultures there are rules and customs about how to give a person a name some of the rules are defined by laws and others are defined by traditions doing things in the way they have been done for a long time there are rules about different aspects of the names and naming including the following number of parts of a name in some cultures a person has a one part name such as shiningwater in other cultures a person has a two part name such as john smith in some cultures a person can have any number of name parts in the united states for example some people have three first name middle name and last name other people have only two a first and last name in chinese cultures it is typical for a person to have three part name such as cheah ching san where cheah is the surname written in english format a comma is introduced making it ching san cheah relations with names of parents and other relatives in some cultures people have the same family name or surname as their parents for example the father of john smith may be mike smith and mike smith s father may be james smith the smith part is the same for all the family in other cultures a person has the same name as his or her father but the name is in a different place for example shafiq hanif s son may be hanif kamal hanif is in both the father s and son s name name changes in some cultures a name changes when people marry divorce go through some religious ceremony etc for example in some spanish speaking countries people use two last names their mother s father s name and their father s name if elena rodriguez gomez and jose sanchez soria marry she may change her name to elena rodriguez de sanchez and their child could be named pilar sanchez rodriguez taking the names of both of her grandfathers name origins in some cultures personal names come from history in most european countries some first names are taken from the bible in some cultures names are taken from a relative in other cultures a name shows what the parents hope their child will be like a baby may be given a name wisdom because parents hope the baby will be a wise girl or boy some cultures avoid giving people a name of an animal for example there is no name like dog cat snake owl or fish in japanese people s first names but in some cultures animal names may be good lengths pronunciations spelling etc in some languages and cultures you can tell if a word is a person s name or not by just looking at the spelling or listening to its pronunciation there are some other linguistic patterns for example many chinese names are made up of three syllables use of names titles nicknames etc in some cultures people use names when they call each other in other cultures people use their nicknames in some other cultures people use their titles father professor etc when they call each other spelling of names titles nicknames etc name awareness taking note of names is taken a step farther by those who elect to celebrate a name e g celebrate your name week whether their own name someone else s name or names in general complete ownership of one s name might very well include celebrating it middle names while some people might choose to hide a middle name for any number of reasons i e they consider the middle name they were given to be an embarrassment others have taken to celebrating their middle name e g middle name pride day in the english language names exclusively are usually pronounced in correlation with the spelling however can be pronounced as desired e g john is jon but can also be ned however not probable is held true in the english rules of grammar examples of names sarah lucy ellen claire ben names can be shortened e g isabelle can become izzy or belle japanese names here are some things that are often found in japanese names today in the past people went by different rules number of parts of a name japanese names have two parts one is the family name and the other is the given name suzuki ichiro is a name of a japanese person suzuki is the family name and ichiro is the first name in the japanese language the family name comes first and the given name comes second it is like writing smith john instead of john smith only some members of the royal family do not have a family name relations with names of parents and other relatives a newborn baby gets a family name from their parents the parents have the same family name so a son of ono yoko female and ono ken male is ono something the family name ono is mostly shared by the paternal male part of the family so ono ken s parents have the family name ono but ono yoko s parents probably do not name changes names of people change when they marry and divorce it is a custom in many parts of the world that women change their family name to that of their new husband when they marry however in europe and north america especially many women no longer do this even though their mothers and grandmothers may have sometimes the man will take the woman s family name name origins lengths pronunciations spelling etc use of names titles nicknames etc niihau or niihau is the smallest of the inhabited islands of hawaii in the united states it has a land area of sq miles km it is the oldest of the eight main islands the whole island is owned by the robinson family they bought it from the kingdom of hawaii for it was said that the buyer elizabeth sinclair later sinclair robinson liked the island better than other places such as waikiki pearl harbor and the island of lanai there is a small us navy base where a handful of navy people work the island has a few hundred permanent inhabitants almost all of them are native hawaiians they support themselves largely with small family farms many work for the ranch owned by the robinsons the native hawaiians lead a rural low tech life they speak the hawaiian language and keep traditions alive this is because ms sinclair promised to help preserve hawaiian culture and tradition when she bought the island niihau is the only one of the hawaiian islands where the hawaiian language is the main language niihau is also known as the forbidden island this is due to the fact that until recently the island was off limits to all but family members us navy personnel government officials and expressly invited guests now tourists can go on one of a limited number of supervised tours or hunting safaris on the beaches of the island are found shells which are the only shells to be classified as gems niihau shells and the jewelry made from them are very popular many especially those with darker and richer color are collectors items the sale of shells and shell jewelry brings extra money for the local people branta sandvicensis the nn or hawaiian goose branta sandvicensis is a species of goose it is found today on only three hawaiian islands it gets its name from its soft call this is an unmistakable species with its generally brown plumage feathers and darker head its strong toes have much reduced webbing skin between the toes an adjustment to the lava flows on which it breeds the nn goes about on land much more than other water birds when moulting dropping old feathers and growing new ones the nn cannot fly as do other geese a factor which made it vulnerable to hunting the nn was once among the most threatened waterfowl species around the world once common hunting and predators brought to the islands such as mongooses pigs and cats reduced the population to only birds in the s however this species breeds well in captivity zoos and bird parks and has been successfully re introduced there are also good numbers in wild bird collections the nn is the state bird of hawaii references a communication network is a group of things that are connected together using some form of talking or other communication to transfer information or data the pattern by which things are connected is called a network topology a television network for example connects television stations computer networks are numerous related pages computer network internet slang is slang words which are used on the internet most of these words are new such as wiki and blog which were not used before the internet became popular some old words were given new meanings such as mail which now means email this makes many metaphors on the internet such as boot which otherwise mean a shoe and link which otherwise means a joint in a metal chain some existing acronyms such as afk to mean away from keyboard and irl to mean in real life were used on bulletin board systems before the internet became popular these are now used on the internet such as in chat rooms and on instant messenger software people have also created some verbs and adjectives to describe things that only happen on the internet to flame to send offensive messages usually in chat rooms forums instant messaging software or email to ping to send some data to another computer and see how long it takes for the data to come back shorthand words shorthand is where a word is written in a shorter way because it is quicker and easier to type it is also done to fit more text into a limited

considered a different part of speech from nouns but in the past some grammars have included them as nouns as do many modern linguists proper nouns proper nouns also called proper name are specific names examples of proper nouns are london john god october mozart saturday coke mr brown atlantic ocean proper nouns are individual things with names not general nouns proper nouns begin with an upper case capital letter in english and many other languages that use the roman alphabet however in german all nouns begin with an upper case letter the word i is really a pronoun although it is capitalized in english like a proper noun some common nouns see below can also be used as proper nouns for example someone might be named tiger smith even though he is not a tiger or a smith common nouns common nouns are general names sometimes the same word can be either a common noun or a proper noun depending on how it is used for example there can be many gods but there is only one god there can be many internets two or more networks connected together but the largest internet in the world is the internet countability in english and many other languages nouns have number but some nouns are only singular such as furniture physics and others are only plural such as clothes police also some nouns are countable for example one piece two pieces but others are uncountable for example we do not say one furniture two furnitures the plural form of most nouns is created simply by adding the letter s more than one snake snakes more than one ski skis more than one barrymore barrymores note that some dictionaries list busses as an acceptable plural for bus presumably this is because the plural buses looks like it ought to rhyme with the plural of fuse which is fuses buses is still listed as the preferable plural form busses is the plural of course for buss a seldom used word for kiss there are several nouns that have irregular plural forms plurals formed in this way are sometimes called mutated or mutating plurals more than one child children more than one woman women more than one man men more than one person people more than one goose geese more than one mouse mice more than one barracks barracks more than one deer deer and finally there are nouns that maintain their latin or greek form in the plural see media and data and alumni below more than one nucleus nuclei more than one syllabus syllabi more than one focus foci more than one fungus fungi more than one cactus cacti cactuses is acceptable more than one thesis theses more than one crisis crises more than one phenomenon phenomena more than one index indices indexes is acceptable more than one appendix appendices appendixes is acceptable more than one criterion criteria more than one octopus octopuses possessives nouns are words for things and since things can be possessed nouns can also change to show possession in grammar in english we usually add an apostrophe and an s to nouns to make them possessive or sometimes just an apostrophe when there is already an s at the end like this this is sam this is sam s cat the woman s hair is long there are three cats the cat s mother is sleeping how

the words nature and natural are used for all the things that are normally not made by humans things like weather organisms landforms celestial bodies and much more are part of nature scientists study the way the parts of nature work things that have been made by people are said to be man made or called artifacts there are natural sciences that study different parts of nature for example the science of ecology is about plants and animals as a whole while biology studies every type of living thing from one point of view humans are a prime example of nature and are the most widely studied natural inhabitants of the planet earth humans interact with each other in their natural environment on a constant basis every part of nature everything from the air to the dirt on the ground is interdependent medicine studies humans in health and sickness from another point of view humans and nature can be said to be in conflict nature is often seen by humans as natural resources people cut down trees mine ores and grow crops fires cars and factories make a lot of smoke and harm many places people who like to leave nature unharmed and those who feel they need to use more of nature often fight about what they should do in the modern world with many more people and many big cities these problems are becoming more serious nature in the broadest sense means the physical world as a whole this is the meaning that physics the study of nature etymologically takes a useful definition of natural is happening or operating in accordance with the ordinary course of nature oxford shorter

a wind farm in belgium a natural resource is what people can use which comes from the natural environment examples of natural resources are air water wood oil wind energy natural gas iron and coal the dividing line between natural resources and man made resources is not clear cut hydro electric energy is not a natural resource because people use turbines to convert the energy from moving water petroleum and iron ores are natural but need work to make them into usable refined oil and steel atomic energy comes from metallic nuclear fuels like fissionable uranium and plutonium but natural rocks need technical work to make them into these nuclear fuels supply we often say there are two sorts of natural resources renewable resources and non renewable resources a renewable resource is one which can be used again and again for example soil sunlight and water are renewable resources however in some circumstances even water is not renewable easily wood is a renewable resource but it takes time to renew and in some places people use the land for something else soil if it blows away is not easy to renew a non renewable resource is a resource that does not grow and come back or a resource that would take a very long time to come back for example coal is a non renewable resource when we use coal there is less coal afterward the non renewable resource can be used directly for example burning oil to cook or we can find a renewable resource to use for example using wind energy to make electricity to cook soil a natural resource for farming most natural resources are limited this means they will eventually run out a perpetual resource has a never ending supply some examples of perpetual resources include solar energy tidal energy and wind energy there may be a limit to how much can be taken in a given day or year but that amount can be taken again next day or next year some of the things influencing supply of resources include whether it is able to be recycled and the availability of suitable substitutes for the material non renewable resources cannot be recycled for example fossil fuels cannot be recycled demand the demand for resources can change with new technology new needs and new economics e g changes in cost of the resources some material can go completely out of use if people do not want it any more demand of many natural resources is very high but availability of some such as precious metals is very low availability different places have different natural resources when people do not have a certain resource they need they can either replace it with another resource or trade with another country to get the resource people have sometimes fought to have them for example spices water arable farmland gold or petroleum when people do not have some resources their quality of life can get lower so people protect resources when they can not get clean water people may become ill if there is not enough wood trees will be cut and the forest will disappear over time deforestation if there are not enough fish in a sea people can die of starvation renewable resources include crops wind hydroelectric power fish and sunlight many people carefully save their natural resources so that others can use them in future references other websites earth s natural wealth negentropy is reverse entropy it means things becoming more in order by order is meant organisation structure and function the opposite of randomness or chaos one example of negentropy is a star system such as the solar system another example is life as a general rule everything in the universe tends towards entropy star systems eventually become dead all energy has gone and everything in the system is at the temperature of the surrounding space the opposite of entropy is negentropy it is a temporary condition in which certain things are hotter and more highly organised than the surrounding space this is the second law of thermodynamics the second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system always increases over time life is considered to be negentropic because it takes things in which have less order like dead food and turns it into things with more order like cells in the body tissues and organs in doing so it gives off heat another example of negentropic things are societies or social systems because they take disorderly things such as communications and make them into order which is useful to people notes north america is a large continent in the northern and western hemispheres of earth it is to the east of the pacific

is a gas giant it is the fourth largest planet and third heaviest neptune has four rings which are hard to see from the earth it is seventeen times heavier than earth and is a little bit heavier than uranus it was named after the roman god of the sea neptune s atmosphere is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium it also contains small amounts of methane which makes the planet appear blue neptune s blue color is much darker compared to the color of uranus which has a similar amount of methane so there might be another reason why neptune is blue neptune also has the strongest winds of any planet in the solar system measured as high as km h or mph neptune was discovered by the astronomers urbain le verrier and john couch adams they were both honored for the discovery the planet was the first to be discovered by mathematical calculations instead of using a telescope uranus was moving oddly in its orbit around the sun so astronomers searched for another new planet the planet was visited by only one spacecraft voyager on august neptune once had a huge storm known as the great dark spot which was discovered in by voyager however the dark spot was not seen in and new spots were found since then it is not known why the dark spot disappeared visits by more space probes have been proposed history discovery urbain le verrier the co discoverer of neptune the first possible sighting of neptune is thought to be by galileo as his drawings showed neptune near jupiter but galileo was not credited for the discovery since he thought neptune was a fixed star instead of a planet because of neptune s slow movement across the sky galileo s small telescope was not strong enough to detect neptune as a planet in alexis bouvard published the astronomical tables of the orbit of uranus later observations showed that uranus was moving in an irregular way in its orbit making some astronomers think of another large body being the cause of the irregular motions of uranus in john couch adams calculated the orbit of an eighth planet that would possibly be influencing the orbit of uranus he sent his calculations to sir george airy the astronomer royal who asked adams for an explanation adams began to make a copy of the reply but never sent it in urbain le verrier who was not working with adams made his own calculations but also failed to get much attention from french astronomers however in the same year john herschel began to support the mathematical method and encouraged james challis to search for the planet after much delay challis began his unwilling search in july meanwhile le verrier had convinced johann gottfried galle to search for the planet although heinrich d arrest was still a student at the berlin observatory he suggested that a newly drawn map of the sky in the region of le verrier s predicted area could be compared with the current sky to look for the change of position of a planet as compared to a fixed star neptune was then discovered that very night on september within one degree angle of where le verrier had predicted it to be and about from adams prediction challis later found out that he had seen the planet twice in august failing to recognize it owing to his careless approach to the work crediting and naming after the news of the discovery of neptune spread there was also a lot of arguing between the french and the british about who was to deserve credit for the discovery later an international agreement decided that both le verrier and adams together deserved credit however historians reviewed the topic after the rediscovery in of the neptune papers historical documents from the royal greenwich observatory which had seemingly been stolen and kept by astronomer olin eggen for nearly three decades and were only rediscovered in his ownership shortly after his death after reviewing the documents some historians now think that adams does not deserve equal credit with le verrier shortly after its discovery neptune was temporarily called the planet exterior to uranus or le verrier s planet the first suggestion for a name came from galle he proposed the name janus in england challis suggested the name oceanus in france arago suggested that the new planet be called leverrier a suggestion which was met with a lot of opposition outside france french almanacs promptly reintroduced the name herschel for uranus and leverrier for the new planet meanwhile on separate and different reason adams suggested changing the name georgian to uranus while leverrier through the board of longitude suggested neptune for the new planet struve gave support of that name on december to the saint petersburg academy of sciences soon neptune was internationally agreed among many people and was then the official name for the new planet in roman mythology neptune was the god of the sea identified with the greek god poseidon structure mass and composition at kg neptune s mass puts the planet between earth and the largest gas giants neptune has seventeen earth masses but just th the mass of jupiter neptune and uranus are often considered to be part of a sub class of gas giant known as ice giants given their smaller size and big differences in composition compared to jupiter and saturn in the search for extrasolar planets neptune has been used as a reference to determine the size and structure of the discovered planet some discovered planets that have similar masses like neptune are often called neptunes just as astronomers refer to various extra solar jupiters the atmosphere of neptune is made up mostly of hydrogen with a smaller amount of helium a tiny amount of methane is also detected in the atmosphere important absorption bands of methane happen at wavelengths above nm in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum this absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane gives neptune its blue hue because neptune orbits so far from the sun it gets very little heat with the uppermost regions of the atmosphere at c k deeper inside the layers of gas however the temperature rises slowly like uranus the source of this heating is unknown but the differences are larger neptune is the farthest planet from the sun yet its internal energy is strong enough to create the fastest winds seen in the solar system several possible explanations have been suggested including radiogenic heating from the planet s core the continued radiation into space of leftover heat made by infalling matter during the planet s birth and gravity waves breaking above the tropopause the structure of the inside of neptune is thought to be very similar to the structure of the inside of uranus there is likely to be a core thought to be about earth masses made up of molten rock and metal surrounded by a mixture of rock water ammonia and methane the heavy pressures keep the icy part of this surrounding mixture as solids in spite of the large temperatures near the core the atmosphere extending about to of the way towards the center is mostly hydrogen and helium at high altitudes more mixtures of methane ammonia and water are found in the lower areas of the atmosphere very slowly this darker and hotter area blends into the superheated liquid interior the pressure at the center of neptune is millions of times more than that on the surface of earth comparing its rotational speed to its degree of oblateness shows that it has its mass less concentrated towards the center unlike uranus weather and magnetic field one difference between neptune and uranus is the level of activity that has been observed seen or measured when the voyager spacecraft flew by uranus in that winds on that planet were observed to be mild when voyager flew by neptune in powerful weather events were observed the weather of neptune has extremely active storm systems its atmosphere has the highest wind speeds in the solar system thought to be powered by the flow of internal heat regular winds in the equatorial region have speeds of around km h mph while winds in storm systems can reach up to km h near supersonic speeds in the great dark spot a cyclonic storm system the size of eurasia was discovered by nasa s voyager spacecraft the storm resembled the great red spot of jupiter however on november the hubble space telescope did not see the great dark spot on the planet instead a new storm similar to the great dark spot was found in the planet s northern hemisphere the reason why the great dark spot has disappeared is unknown one possible theory is that heat transfer from the planet s core disrupted the atmospheric balance and existing circulation patterns the scooter is another storm a white cloud group farther south than the great dark spot its nickname was given when it was first noticed in the months leading up to the voyager encounter in it moved faster than the great dark spot later images showed clouds that moved even faster than scooter the wizard s eye dark spot is another southern cyclonic storm the second most strongest storm seen during the encounter it originally was completely dark but as voyager came closer to the planet a bright core developed and is seen in most of the highest resolution images unlike other gas giants neptune s atmosphere shows the presence of high clouds making shadows on a thick cloud deck below though neptune s atmosphere is much more active than that of uranus both planets are made up of the same gases and ices uranus and neptune are not exactly the same type of gas giants like to jupiter and saturn but are rather ice giants meaning they have a larger solid core and are also made of ices neptune is very cold with temperatures as low as c f or k recorded at the cloud tops in neptune also has similarities with uranus in its magnetosphere with a magnetic field strongly tilted comparative to its rotational axis at and offset at least radii about kilometres from the planet s physical center comparing the magnetic fields of the two planets scientists think the extreme course may be characteristic of flows in the interior of the planet and not the result of uranus sideways rotational movement neptune s rings neptune s rings very small blue colored rings have been discovered around the blue planet but they are not as well known as the rings of saturn when these rings were discovered by a team led by edward guinan originally they thought that the rings may not be complete rings however this was proven wrong by voyager neptune s planetary rings have a weird clumpy arrangement although the cause is currently unknown but some scientists think that it may be because of the gravitational contact with small moons that orbit near them proof that the rings are incomplete first began in the mid s when stellar occultation were found to rarely show an extra blink just before or after the planet occulted the star pictures from voyager in solved the problem when the ring system was found to have several faint rings the farthest ring adams has three famous arcs now named libert egalit and fraternit liberty equality and fraternity the existence of arcs is very hard to understand because the laws of motion would predict that arcs spread out into a single ring in a very short time the gravitational effects of galatea a moon just inward from the ring are now thought to have created the arcs several other rings were discovered by the voyager cameras also with the thin adams ring about km from the center of neptune the leverrier ring is at km and the wider smaller galle ring is at km a very small outward expansion to the leverrier ring has been named lassell it is surrounded at its outer edge by the arago ring at km new earth based observations published in appeared to show that neptune s rings are a lot more unstable than thought before to be exact it looks like that the libert ring might disappear maybe quickly in less than years the new observations seems to puzzle our understanding of neptune s rings into a lot of confusion neptune s moons neptune has a total of known moons as neptune was the roman god of the sea the planet s moons were named after lesser sea gods or goddesses the largest and the only one big enough to have the shape of a sphere is triton pronounced discovered by william lassell just days after the discovery of neptune itself unlike all other large planetary moons triton has a retrograde orbit showing that the moon was probably captured and maybe was once a kuiper belt object it is close enough to neptune to be locked into a synchronous orbit and is slowly moving into neptune and will one day be torn apart when it passes the roche limit triton is the coldest object that has been measured in the solar system with temperatures of c k f its diamter is km of earth s moon luna its mass is kg of luna its orbital diameter is km of luna and its orbital period is days of luna neptune s second known moon by order of distance the odd moon nereid has one of the most unusual orbits of any satellite in the solar system from july to september voyager discovered six new moons of neptune of these the lumpy shaped proteus is the biggest known object that has not been shaped into a sphere by its own gravity although it is the second most massive neptunian moon it has only one quarter of one percent of the mass of triton neptune s closest four moons naiad thalassa despina and galatea orbit close enough to be inside neptune s rings the next farthest out larissa was originally discovered in when it had occulted a star the moon was credited for causing neptune s ring arcs when voyager observed neptune in five new unusual moons discovered between and were announced in the latest moon was discovered from examining hubble telescope imags on july it is only miles across allowing it to evade detection even by the voyager spacecraft observation neptune cannot be seen with naked eye alone since neptune s normal brightness are between magnitudes and which can be out shined by jupiter s galilean moons the dwarf planet ceres and the asteroids vesta pallas iris juno and hebe a telescope or strong binoculars will show neptune as a small blue dot similar in appearance to uranus the blue color comes from the methane in its atmosphere its small obvious size has made it difficult to study visually most telescopic data was quite limited until the arrival of the hubble space telescope and large ground based telescopes with adaptive optics with an orbital period sidereal period of julian years neptune will soon return for discovery to the same place in the sky where it was discovered in this will happen three different times also with a fourth in which it will come very close to being at that position these are april when it will be in prograde motion july when it will be in retrograde motion and february when it will be in prograde motion it will also come very close to being at the same point since the discovery in late october through early mid november when neptune will turn from retrograde to direct motion on the exact degree of neptune s discovery and will then stop for a moment along the ecliptic within arc minutes at that point closest on november this will be the last time for about the next years that neptune will be at its point of discovery this is explained by the idea of retrogradation like all planets and asteroids in the solar system beyond earth neptune goes through retrogradation at certain points during its synodic period in addition to the start of retrogradation other events inside the synodic period include astronomical opposition the return to prograde motion and conjunction to the sun in its orbit around the sun neptune returned to its original point of discovery in august exploration voyager currently only one spacecraft has visited neptune nasa s voyager probe made a quick flyby of the planet with its closest encounter on august and was the last planet to have been visited by at least one spacecraft some of voyager s important discoveries was its very close fly by of triton where took pictures of several parts of the moon the probe also discovered the great dark spot although it has now disappeared after when the hubble space telescope took pictures of neptune in originally thought to be a large cloud or cyclonic storm system it was later guessed just to be a hole in the visible cloud deck neptune turned out to have the strongest winds of all the solar system s gas giants in the outer regions of the solar system where the sun shines over times fainter than on earth still very bright with a magnitude of the last of the four giants did happen as what the scientists actually expected one might think that the farther a planet is from the sun the less energy and heat there would be to create and run the very strong winds around the winds on jupiter were already hundreds of kilometres per hour rather than seeing slower winds the scientists found faster winds over km h on more distant neptune one possible guess for the cause of the faster wind speeds is that if enough energy is produced turbulence is created which slows the winds down like those of jupiter at neptune however there is so little solar energy that once winds are started they meet very little resistance and are able to keep very high speeds anyhow neptune gives out more energy than it gets from the sun and the internal energy source of these winds remains undetermined the pictures sent back to earth from voyager in became the basis of a pbs all night program called

punctuation capitalization and diacritics e g accents in english spelling is a problem for all learners and is the main issue in orthography some languages have someone to decide the correct spelling such as the acadmie franaise english does not english orthography was the work of the early printers they had to decide how particular words would be spelled in their books gradually the number of alternative spellings began to drop the word which is merry today was spelled in about ways in written sources from the th to the th century p english orthography english orthography or english spelling is the way the letters of the alphabet are used to write down the ipa sounds of english the first manuscripts in old english were written using the latin alphabet it had letters p vowels no alphabet fits its language exactly one reason for this is that there are always more sounds than letters in english there are far more vowel sounds than vowels the ancient greeks who were the first to use letters for vowels decided to use only a few letters for their vowel sounds this choice influenced all later alphabets the importance of the greeks in the history of alphabetic writing is paramount all the alphabets in use in europe today stand in direct or indirect relation to the ancient greek english would need about vowels to represent the vowel phonemes sounds in common use p and some languages do have more letters for vowels the georgian language has a total of letters a shorter alphabet works by using two or three letters for a single sound or one letter for several sounds consonants the english alphabet has only three consonants which have one sound cannot be produced by other combinations and are never silent n r and v the english language uses to consonant phonemes dialects the other reason that alphabets never exactly fit languages is dialect a spoken language varies from place to place and from time to time this is very obvious with english as the pronunciation is so different in different parts of the world a written language will always be less flexible than its spoken parent it has a different function and is produced mechanically it must serve everyone who speaks the language and it does this by keeping the spelling similar from one time to another therefore all alphabets have sounds which are difficult to represent with the letters in use and english also has other problems sounds that can be written in different ways and spelling which can be pronounced in different ways this all gives rise to problems of spelling british and american english differences between american english and british english spelling came about mainly as the result of one man noah webster wrote a grammar a spelling book and finally an american dictionary of the english language in the course of this he proposed a number of simplifications in spelling in his dictionary he chose s over c in words like defense he changed the re to er in words like center he dropped one of the ls in traveler at first he kept the u in words like colour or favour but dropped it in later editions he also changed tongue to tung that did not stick his main reason was to help children learn to read and write webster s dictionary contained seventy thousand words of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before webster did create a slightly different identity for american english but because his efforts did not address some of the most glaring problems his variations make little difference to the way the language is used an example of the real problems in english orthography is the word ending ough which is pronounced several different ways tough bough cough the root causes of spelling variation are historical loan words come with their own foreign spelling some french loan words are still spelled in the french way others have been changed english spelling reform has been proposed by many people since webster such as george bernard shaw who proposed a new phonetic alphabet for english in some cases webster s changes have been widely adopted in britain the spelling programme came from the french us program is clearly simpler and more consistent with word endings in english in our modern world english orthography is still a problem in some countries notably france a national committee can give advice and direction as to spelling english has long escaped from national custody spelling though important is less important than how the language is used in practice the differences between british and american english in use are more to do with idiom slang and vocabulary than they are to do with spelling in this respect spelling in writing or print is a bit like pronunciation in speech they are the necessary outer clothes but the inner substance is more important in wikipedia note the spelling articles may be in either american or british english but should be consistent within each article more details wikipedia manual of style dictionaries and phonetics modern british spelling and use was greatly influenced by the two great english dictionaries samuel johnson s a dictionary of the english language and james murray s oxford english dictionary johnson s dictionary was hugely influential abroad as well as at home the dictionary was exported to america the american adoption of the dictionary was a momentous event not just in its history but in the history of lexicography for americans in the second half of the eighteenth century johnson was the authority on language and the subsequent development of american dictionaries was coloured by his fame p for american lexicographers the dictionary was impossible to ignore america s two great nineteenth century lexicographers noah webster and joseph emerson worcester argued fiercely over johnson s legacy in webster declared that great britain whose children we are and whose language we speak should no longer be our standard for the taste of her writers is already corrupted and her language on the decline where webster found fault with johnson joseph worcester saluted him in he completed his universal and critical dictionary of the english language p some people argue which language is the easiest to spell people who learn a second language tend to think that their first native language is the easiest however for the learner programmatic languages with well defined rules are easier to start with than english the spelling of the english language is by far the most irregular of all alphabetic spellings and thus the most difficult to learn english is in its origin a germanic language from its early roots as anglo saxon it has borrowed words from many other languages french a romance language and latin are the most frequent donors to english languages that use phonetic spelling are easier to learn to spell than others with phonetic spelling the words are spelled as they are pronounced the italian word orologio for instance is pronounced oh ro lo jo gi always making a j sound in english one comes across the word knife in knife the k is not spoken even though in english it s more common to pronounce k s when they are in words history of english spelling one of the problems we have is that similar sounding words may be spelt quite differently rough and ruff meet and meat great and grate words with complicated spelling may be pronounced simply leicester is pronounced lester even what rules we do have are frequently broken i before e except after c has over exceptions p almost all these problems have come about for historical reasons english has been changing for the last thousand years and as the language changes so parts of it get stuck with different spellings here are some of the causes of english orthography originally a letter alphabet for the or so phonemes sounds of old english other letters were added later after the norman conquest french scribes introduced new spellings printing many of the early printers came from the continent of europe and brought other spelling norms to england but although print stabilised spelling pronunciation continued to change printing coincided with the great vowel shift at the end of middle english end th to th centuries to avoid complex details here is what happened over a century the pronunciation of all the vowels changed and is still not standard throughout britain in any event the spelling of thousands of words now reflects their pronunciation in geoffrey chaucer s time th century scholars tried to indicate the history of a word by its spelling the silent b in debt is there to reflect the latin debitum more loan words added in the late th to early th century such as pneumonia idiosyncrasy epitome cocoa english has a huge number of words but its spelling comes from many different sources the large and varied lexicon of english has been bought at the expense of an increasingly deversified graphology p differences between languages some languages have a high correspondence between phonemes and letters that means they get close to one letter for each sound if there was a perfect correspondence that language would have phonemic orthography english is highly non phonemic it has almost every kind of deviation known different letters for the same sound two or more letters for a single sound sound depends on nearby letters vast range of words whose sound varies according to dialect huge number of loan words with imported spellings defective it does not represent some important differences in phonemes example the difference between the voiced th the and the unvoiced th thin this field of study is called orthographic depth the orthographic depth of an alphabetic script is the degree to which a written language deviates from simple one to one letter phoneme correspondence it shows how easy it is to predict the pronunciation of a word from its spelling shallow orthographies are easy to pronounce based on the written word and deep orthographies are difficult to pronounce based on how they are written in shallow orthographies the spelling sound correspondence is direct given the rules of pronunciation one is able to say the word correctly most other international languages have similar problems in french arabic or hebrew new readers have difficulty learning to decode words as a result children learn to read more slowly in both spanish and italian there is a more direct connection between spelling and pronunciation those are languages with low orthographic depth related pages ghoti references natural olive oil synthetic motor oil the word oil is used for many different kinds of liquids oil usually does not mix with water

seem to be opposite to each other or actually are opposite for example the words wise fool warm freezer legal murder all have two words in each one the one word looks like the opposite of the other word you can have words that look opposite but are right for example a warm freezer could be right a freezer could be warm if it was turned off or left open the word oxymoron is an oxymoron oxy comes from the greek word that means sharp while moron comes from the greek word that means dull words that really are opposite to each other would be words that just cannot be put together for example a round square could not happen because squares are not round oxymorons sometimes appear in jokes sometimes the joke is just to say that a pair of words are an oxymoron for example a joke that says that honest politician is an oxymoron this means that politicians are dishonest if the word politician is opposite to honest related pages paradox trope references ubuntu gnu linux a free operating system

greek statue louvre museum philosophy is a way of thinking about the world the universe and society it works by asking very basic questions about the nature of human thought the nature of the universe and the connections between them the ideas in philosophy are often general and abstract but this does not mean that philosophy is not about the real world ethics for example asks about how to be good in our day to day lives metaphysics asks about how the world works and what it is made of sometimes people talk about how they have a personal philosophy which means the way a person thinks about the world this article is not about people s personal philosophies this article is about the ideas that have been discussed by philosophers people who think and write about ways of thinking for a long time one philosophical question is this is there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no reasonable man could doubt it other questions asked by philosophers are these what is good what is beauty do we have free will does god exist does the world around us exist what is a person what is truth what is evil what is the relationship between mind and body what is science what is philosophy what is love history the word philosophy comes from two greek words meaning love of wisdom philos adj beloved sophia fem noun wisdom there are different types of philosophy from different times and places some philosophers came from ancient greece such as plato and aristotle others came from asia such as confucius or buddha some philosophers are from the middle ages in europe such as william of ockham or saint thomas aquinas philosophers from the s s and s included thomas hobbes ren descartes john locke david hume and immanuel kant philosophers from the s included ludwig wittgenstein and jean paul sartre areas of inquiry philosophy is the study of humans and the world by thinking and asking questions it is a science and an art philosophy tries to answer important questions by coming up with answers about real things and asking why sometimes philosophy tries to answer the same questions as religion and science philosophers do not all give the same answers to questions some people think there are no right answers in philosophy only better answers and worse answers many types of philosophy criticize or even attack the beliefs of science and religion in his work critique of pure reason immanuel kant asked the following questions what can i say what shall i do what dare i hope what is man the answers to these questions gives the different domains or categories of philosophy categories in philosophy philosophy can be divided into different groups based on the types of questions that it asks below is a list of questions split into groups one possible list of answers to these questions can be called a philosophy there are many different philosophies because all of these questions have many different answers according to different people not all philosophies ask the same questions these are the questions that are usually asked by philosophers from the western world metaphysics metaphysics is sometimes split up into ontology the philosophy of real life and living things the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of religion but these sub branches are very close together ontology what is the world that we see around us what is reality is there more to the world than just what we see or hear if nobody sees something happening does that mean that it did not happen what does it mean to say that something is possible do other worlds exist is there anything very special about being a human being or being alive at all if not why do some people think that there is what is space what is time the philosophy of mind what is a mind what is a body what is consciousness do people make choices or can they only choose to do one thing do people have free will what makes words or ideas meaningful what is the relation between meaningful words or ideas and the things that they mean the philosophy of religion do people have souls is there a god who created the universe in epistemology what is knowledge how can we know anything what is science what is truth in ethics what are right and wrong good and bad should people do some things and not others what is justice in aesthetics what is beauty what if one person thinks a painting is beautiful but another person thinks the painting is ugly can the painting be beautiful and ugly at the same time are true things beautiful are good things beautiful what is art we commonly think that a sculpture in a museum is art if a sculptor sculpts a sculpture of a rock from clay and puts it in a museum many would call it art but what if a person picks up a rock from the ground is the rock a piece of art in logic what do the words we use mean how can we say things especially ideas in a way that only has one meaning can all ideas be expressed using language how does the truth of an argument s premise affect the truth of its conclusion how can we reason correctly in axiology what has value is time really money or have we made it so does love beauty or justice hold any value other divisions include eschatology teleology and theology in past centuries natural science was included in philosophy and called natural philosophy is philosophy good or bad does philosophy do any good very few people would dispute this it is easy to argue that philosophy is a good thing because it helps people to think more clearly philosophy helps people to understand the world and the way people act and think philosophers believe that asking philosophical questions is useful because it brings wisdom and helps people to learn about the world and each other some philosophers might even argue that the question is philosophy good or bad is a philosophical question itself however some people think that philosophy is harmful as philosophy encourages free thinking and often questions the beliefs that others hold for example philosophies such as some existentialist views say that there is no meaning to life or human existence except the meaning that we make up or invent people from some religions do not agree with the beliefs of existentialism it should be noted that every major science including physics biology and chemistry are all disciplines that originally were considered philosophy as speculation and analysis about nature became more developed these subjects branched away this is a process that continues even today psychology only split in the past century in our own time subjects such as consciousness studies decision theory and applied ethics have increasingly found independence from philosophy as a whole because of this philosophy seems useful because it makes new kinds of science what philosophers do philosophers ask questions about ideas concepts they try to find answers to those questions some thinkers find it very hard to find those words that best describe the ideas they have when they find answers to some of these questions philosophers often have the same problem that is how to best tell the answers they found to other people depending on the meaning of the words they use the answers change some philosophers are full time thinkers called academics who work for universities or colleges these philosophers write books and articles about philosophy and teach classes about philosophy to university or college students other philosophers are just hobby thinkers who think about philosophy during their free time a small number of hobby thinkers have thought so much about philosophy that they are able to write articles for philosophy magazines other people approach philosophy from another job for example monks artists and scientists may think about philosophical ideas and questions most philosophers work by asking questions and looking for good definitions meanings of words to help them understand what a question means some philosophers say the only thing needed to answer a question is to find out what it means the only thing that makes philosophical questions such as those above difficult is that people do not really know what they mean ludwig wittgenstein believed this philosophers often use both real and imaginary examples to make a point for example they may write about a real or fictional person in order to show what they think a good person or a bad person is like some philosophers look for the simplest way to answer a question and say that is probably the right answer this is a process called occam s razor others believe that complicated answers to questions can also be right for an example of a philosophical problem see the god paradox philosophers use logic to solve problems and answer questions logical consistency is a cornerstone of any acceptable theory philosophers who disagree with a theory will often try to find a logical contradiction in a theory if they find a contradiction this gives them a reason to reject that theory if they do not find an inconsistency the philosopher might show that the theory leads to a conclusion which is either unacceptable or ridiculous this second approach is usually called reductio ad absurdum some philosophers people listed here should be genuine philosophers rather than social or political campaigners the lists are

is a branch of science it is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines the main goal of physics is to explain how things move in space and time and understand how the universe behaves it studies matter forces and their effects the word physics comes from the greek word meaning nature physics can also be defined as that department of knowledge which relates to the order of nature or in other words to the regular succession of events astronomy a part of physics is the oldest natural science in the past it was a part of natural philosophy with other fields of science such as chemistry and biology during the scientific revolution these fields became separate and physics became a distinct field of knowledge physics is very important in the development of new technologies such as airplanes televisions computers and nuclear weapons mechanics a branch of physics helped develop the mathematical field of calculus modern physics connects ideas about the four laws of symmetry and conservation of energy momentum charge and parity history ancient astronomy astronomy is the oldest natural science the sumerians and ancient egyptians studied the stars mostly with a view to prediction and religion the first babylonian star maps date from about bc that astronomical events are periodic also dates back to the babylonians their understanding was not scientific but their observations influenced later astronomy much astronomy came from mesopotamia babylonia ancient egypt and ancient greece astronomers from egypt built monuments that showed how objects in the sky moved and most of the names for the constellations in the northern hemisphere came from greek astronomers natural philosophy natural philosophy started in greece around bc when a movement of philosophers replaced superstition with naturalism which refuted the spiritual leucippus and his student democritus suggested the idea of the atom around this period physics in the medieval islamic world islamic scholars continued to study aristotelian physics during the islamic golden age one main contribution was to observational astronomy some like ibn sahl al kindi ibn al haytham al farisi and avicenna worked on optics and vision in the book of optics ibn al haytham rejected previous greek ideas concerning vision and proposed a new theory he studied how light enters the eye and developed the camera obscura european scientists later built eyeglasses magnifying glasses telescopes and cameras from this book classical physics physics became a separate field of study after the scientific revolution galileo s experiments helped to create classical physics although he did not invent the telescope he used it when he looked into the night sky he supported copernicus idea that the earth moved around the sun heliocentrism he also investigated gravity isaac newton used galileo s ideas to create his three laws of motion in a couple centuries the industrial revolution was in full swing and many more discoveries were made in many fields of science the laws of classical physics are good enough to study objects that move much slower than the speed of light and are not microscopic when scientists first studied quantum mechanics they had to create a new set of laws which was the start of modern physics modern physics as scientists researched particles they discovered what classical mechanics could not explain classical mechanics predicted that the speed of light varied but experiments showed the speed of light stayed the same this was predicted by albert einstein s theory of special relativity einstein predicted that the speed of electromagnetic radiation through empty space would always be the same his view of space time replaced the ancient idea that space and time were quite separate things max planck came up with quantum mechanics to explain why metal releases electrons when you shine a light at it and why matter emits radiation quantum mechanics applies for very small things like the electrons protons and neutrons that make up an atom people like werner heisenberg erwin schrdinger and paul dirac continued to work on quantum mechanics and eventually we got the standard model definition physics is the study of energy and matter in space and time and how they are related to each other physicists assume the existence of mass length time and electric current and then define give the meaning of all other physical quantities in terms of these basic units mass length time and electric current are never defined but the standard units used to measure them are always defined in the international system of units abbreviated si from the french s ystme i nternational the kilogram is the basic unit of mass the metre is the basic unit of length the second is the basic unit of time and the ampere is the basic unit of electric current in addition to these four units there are three other ones the mole which is the unit of the quantity of matter the candela which measures the luminous intensity the power of lighting and the kelvin the unit of temperature physics studies how things move and the forces that make them move for example velocity and acceleration are used by physics to show how things move also physicists study the forces of gravity electricity magnetism and the forces that hold things together physics studies very large things and very small things for instance physicists can study stars planets and galaxies but could also study small pieces of matter such as atoms and electrons they may also study sound light and other waves as well as that they could examine energy heat and radioactivity and even space and time physics not only helps people understand how objects move but how they change form how they make noise how hot or cold they will be and what they are made of at the smallest level physics and mathematics physics is a quantitative science because it is based on measuring with numbers mathematics is used in physics to make models that try to predict what will happen in nature these predictions are compared to the way the real world works physicists are always working to make their models of the world better advanced knowledge general description physics is the science of matter and how matter interacts matter is any physical material in the universe everything is made of matter physics is used to describe the physical universe around us and to predict how it will behave physics is the science concerned with the discovery and characterization of the universal laws which govern matter movement and forces and space and time and other features of the natural world breadth and goals of physics the sweep of physics is broad from the smallest components of matter and the forces that hold it together to galaxies and even larger things there are only four forces that appear to operate over this whole range however even these four forces gravity electromagnetism the weak force associated with radioactivity and the strong force which holds protons and neutrons in an atom together are believed to be different parts of a single force physics is mainly focused on the goal of making ever simpler more general and more accurate rules that define the character and behavior of matter and space itself one of the major goals of physics is making theories that apply to everything in the universe in other words physics can be viewed as the study of those universal laws which define at the most basic level possible the behavior of the physical universe physics uses the scientific method physics uses the scientific method that is data from experiments and observations are collected theories which attempt to explain these data are produced physics uses these theories to not only describe physical phenomena but to model physical systems and predict how these physical systems will behave physicists then compare these predictions to observations or experimental evidence to show whether the theory is right or wrong the theories that are well supported by data and are especially simple and general are sometimes called scientific laws of course all theories including those known as laws can be replaced by more accurate and more general laws when a disagreement with data is found physics is quantitative physics is more quantitative than most other sciences that is many of the observations in physics may be represented in the form of numerical measurements most of the theories in physics use mathematics to express their principles most of the predictions from these theories are numerical this is because of the areas which physics has addressed work better with quantitative approaches than other areas sciences also tend to become more quantitative with time as they become more highly developed and physics is one of the oldest sciences fields of physics classical physics normally includes the fields of mechanics optics electricity magnetism acoustics and thermodynamics modern physics is a term normally used to cover fields which rely on quantum theory including quantum mechanics atomic physics nuclear physics particle physics and condensed matter physics as well as the more modern fields of general and special relativity but these last two are often considered fields of classical physics as they do not rely on quantum theory although this difference can be found in older writings it is of little new interest as quantum effects are now understood to be of importance even in fields that before were called classical approaches in physics there are many approaches to studying physics and many different kinds of activities in physics there are two main types of activities in physics the collection of data and the development of theories the data in some subfields of physics is amenable to experiment for example condensed matter physics and nuclear physics benefit from the ability to perform experiments experimental physics focuses mainly on an empirical approach sometimes experiments are done to explore nature and in other cases experiments are performed to produce data to compare with the predictions of theories some other fields in physics like astrophysics and geophysics are mostly observational sciences because most of their data has to be collected passively instead of through experimentation however observational programs in these fields use many of the same tools and technology that are used in the experimental subfields of physics theoretical physics often uses quantitative approaches to develop the theories that attempt to explain the data in this way theoretical physicists often use tools from mathematics theoretical physics often can involve creating quantitative predictions of physical theories and comparing these predictions quantitatively with data theoretical physics sometimes creates models of physical systems before data is available to test and support these models these two main activities in physics data collection theory production and testing use many different skills this has led to a lot of specialization in physics and the introduction development and use of tools from other fields for example theoretical physicists use mathematics and numerical analysis and statistics and probability and computer software in their work experimental physicists develop instruments and techniques for collecting data using engineering and computer technology and many other fields of technology often the tools from these other areas are not quite appropriate for the needs of physics and need to be changed or more advanced versions have to be made it is frequent for new physics to be discovered if experimental physicists do an experiment that current theories cannot explain or for theoretical physicists to generate theories which can then be put to the test by experimental physicists experimental physics engineering and technology are related experiments often need specialized tools such as particle accelerators lasers and important industrial applications such as transistors and magnetic resonance imaging have come from applied research physicists

measurements question politics is the way that people living in groups make decisions politics is about making agreements between people so that they can live together in groups such as tribes cities or countries in large groups such as countries some people may spend a lot of their time making such agreements these people are called politicians politicians and sometimes other people may get together to form a government the study of politics in universities is called political science political studies or public administration in everyday life the term politics refers to the way that countries are governed and to the ways that governments make rules and laws politics can also be seen in other groups such as in companies clubs schools and churches government the government tries to lead the whole group governments do things such as decide which people get which pieces of land decide which people can tell other people what to do decide whether to go to war with another country create money build things for the use of the whole group such as roads hospitals libraries and docks educate people either for their own good or to teach them what the government wants them to know take care of the very young the sick or the very old manage the welfare of the country and manages the money available for spending on services hospitals schools etc one of the ways the government leads the group is by making laws and rules which tell everybody what they can and can not do the government makes these laws so that society will be safe and well ordered the law that you must not drink alcohol while driving a car stops people from drunk driving which could kill people the law you must wear a helmet on a motorcycle makes sure that people protect themselves the government can also control people and what happens in a country in other ways besides making laws for example how the government spends its money makes a big difference in what people will do or what will happen to people if the government spends a lot of money on hospitals and nurses the people will probably become healthier also if people like their government or think that their government is wise they may do something just because their government says it is a good thing to do governments often make posters or television advertisements that encourage people to stop smoking cigarettes or eat more fruits and vegetables politics is often compared to ethics ideas about right and wrong ethics is a more abstract study of right and wrong ethics is usually more concerned with principle than law or politics or diplomacy so many people think ethics is not practical but without some agreement on ethics there is probably no way to even have a debate laws or an election there is always some agreement on ethics and personal conduct in a political system political parties in most countries people have formed political parties to put forward their ideas there is usually some disagreement between people within a party but they work together because they feel that they agree on enough things and they will have more power if they join together they agree to take the same position on many issues and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders an election is usually a competition between different parties some examples of parties are the liberal party the labor party and the greens history the greek philosopher aristotle wrote that humans are a political animal and that ethics and politics are closely linked niccol machiavelli wrote in his book the prince that politics was firstly about having and keeping power he said that without power a leader could do nothing in thomas hobbes wrote leviathan a book about politics hobbes wrote that people living in groups often give up some of their rights in exchange for some protections from a government in the s john stuart mill developed the liberal idea of politics mill said that democracy is the most important political development of the s he said that there should be more protection for individual rights against the government bernard crick wrote a list of the political virtues which were about best practices of politics itself international politics there are also disagreements between different countries attempts to solve the problem with meetings are called diplomacy this is politics between nations instead of politics within nations if the problems are not resolved by diplomatic meetings they can lead to war or terrorism related pages political economy constitution geopolitics a value or principle usually means an abstract rule one that can be seen to apply in many experiences or can be applied by choice in a lot of situations it can also mean a moral choice one makes often and consistently for example some buddhists avoid eating meat as a matter of principle many groups of people agree on lists of principles they may also try to agree on the order in which they are to apply that is which principles should be violated before which other ones they might also try to list best practices which reflect the principles in the right order and provide more practical less abstract instruction in cartoons and comics profanity is often depicted by substituting symbols for words grawlixes in the lexicon of cartoonist mort walker profanity means swear words the adjective is profane profanities can also be called curse cuss words dirty words bad words foul language obscenity obscene language or expletives it can be called swearing although this also has a normal meaning of making a solemn promise a profanity usually refers to religion sex or bodily functions these are things that people feel very strongly about in some languages such as french there is more profanity about religion than most other topics this is the original meaning from a latin word meaning before the temple religious profanity is called blasphemy the verb is to blaspheme and the adjective is blasphemous saying god or jesus christ as an expression of surprise or annoyance is considered by many to be blasphemy mostly because one of the ten commandments says not to use god s name in vain without substance or without relevance swearing oaths can also be considered wrong by some who follow jesus teaching against swearing oaths in the gospels such as matthew a profanity can be a word or gesture or some other form of behaviour different words can be profane to different people and what words are thought of as profanity in english can change over time whether a word is a profanity will always depend on the way people think some people will be offended by something while others will not be words which should not be used are taboo words using such words is thought by some people to be a sin for example some christians and some muslims believe that swearing is a sin opinions on profanity some people call profanity crude but some say that it is no cruder to say damn or crap than it is to use hate a word that is about a very strong emotion but not a swear word people who use profanity do not always mean to make anybody feel bad and tolerance for different forms of profanity can vary widely from person to person most often using profanity is a verbal outlet for strong feelings usually unpleasant ones that might otherwise cause a physical reaction at other times some people may use profanity as humor coprolalia coprolalia is a mental condition that makes people use profanity constantly this is called coprolalia it is different from tourette syndrome tourette syndrome is actually a group of symptoms that only includes coprolalia of the time the condition can be made worse by stress examples of profanity several of these words come from anglo saxon or norse names for body parts and bodily functions they came to be thought of as profanity mostly after the normans brought french and latin words for them to england ass or arse means the buttocks asshole or arsehole means the anus bastard a term for a child who was born to unmarried parents also used as an insult for an unpleasant person bitch a female dog also used as an offensive term for a disliked person cock or dick these terms refer to the penis and or as an insult for a unpleasant person or a fool cunt or pussy a vagina also used as an offensive term for a disliked person fuck a verb meaning to have sex piss urine also a verb meaning to urinate shit or shite feces also a verb meaning to defecate profane gestures these are mostly performed while facing another person and can be meant toward them or about them these gestures are considered as strong as profane words in most cases biting one s thumb performed by placing the tip of a thumb under the front teeth then pulling the thumb slightly forward with the fingers closed mocks the thumbs up gesture can be taken to mean bite me though it predates the common use of this phrase grabbing one s own crotch also an invitation to bite me or to perform oral sex in a way pretending to give fellatio one pokes out a cheek with the tongue while rocking a closed hand toward the mouth at the same time indicates something or someone is a waste of time pretending to masturbate indicates something or someone is a waste of time or performs poorly showing one s middle finger flipping the bird understood generally to mean fuck you or fuck off showing a reversed v sign understood generally to mean fuck you or fuck off thumbing or fluting one s nose performed by placing the tip of a thumb against the tip of the nose then wiggling the fingers expresses or thinking that someone is foolish up yours one turns a forearm horizontally while swinging the other fist and forearm around it suggests something being shoved into a person s if the middle finger is shown it is a stronger form of fuck you or a suggestion of anal sex references proof could mean an argument including mathematical proof proof theory a branch of mathematical logic

china prc is a one party state in east asia governed by the communist party of china it was founded on september it currently has more than billion people as of which is more than any other country in the world it covers an area of million square kilometers the capital city is beijing and shanghai is the city with the most people living in it along with the cities of tianjin and chongqing these four cities are municipalities directly controlled by the national government two other cities are given the status of special administrative region sar they are hong kong which was once a colony of the united kingdom and given back to china in and macau which portugal gave back in these two cities remain highly autonomous or have much of their own power aside from the municipalities and the sar s there are provinces and five autonomous regions or regions with more law making rights than the provinces and with many people of a minority group population they are the xinjiang uyghur autonomous region the tibet autonomous region or xizang autonomous region the guangxi zhuang autonomous region the inner mongolia autonomous region or nei mongol autonomous region and the ningxia hui autonomous region in the sar s the central government is responsible for defense and foreign affairs but not the daily operations for years prc claims taiwan as one of its many provinces however prc does not have control of taiwan which has an entirely different political system and officially known as the republic of china taiwan history china has one of the world s oldest civilizations and has the oldest continuous civilization it has archaeological evidence over years old it also has one of the world s oldest writing systems and the oldest in use today and is viewed as the source of many major inventions ancient b c a d ancient china was one of the first civilizations and was active since the nd millennium bc as a feudal society chinese civilization was also one of the few to invent writing with the others being mesopotamia the indus valley civilization the maya civilization the minoan civilization of ancient greece and ancient egypt it reached its golden age during the tang dynasty c a d th century home of confucianism and daoism it had great influence on nearby countries including japan korea and vietnam in the areas of political system philosophy religion art and even writing and literature china is home to some of the oldest artwork in the world statues and pottery as well as decorations made of jade are some classic examples before the qin dynasty united china there were hundreds of small states that fought each other for hundreds of years in a war to control china this is known as the warring states period although the continuing wars made people suffer it was at this time when many of the great philosophies of the east were born including confucianism and daoism confucianism and daoism alone have been the foundation of many social values seen in modern eastern asian cultures today its geography mostly looked like that of modern china except with northern and western edges that varied it was often attacked by northern nomadic people such as the turkic tribes and the mongols lead by genghis khan and kublai khan during the history of ancient china the northern nomadic people and the chinese people had been fighting each other and taking turns to rule the land and the people of china however when the northern people beat the chinese people and came to rule the kingdom they also incorporated the chinese way of living and became like the chinese many of the strongest dynasties of china were ruled by the northern people including the qin tang yuan mongolian and qing manchu each time they also brought new elements into the chinese culture a new age while china achieved many things in the first millennium and early nd millennium it became an isolationist country in the th century c e this was because spain found a lot of silver in the newly explored continents of north and south america silver was the main currency money in china and europe at the time and china did not want to be bought by the foreigners by the time of the renaissance european powers started to take over other countries in asia during this time the opium epidemic was growing in china foreign traders primarily british had been illegally exporting opium mainly from india to china since the th century but that trade grew dramatically from about the resulting widespread addiction in china was causing serious social and economic disruption there this led to what is now known as the first opium war the first opium war between china and great britain lasted from to the conflict was the result of years of attempts by the british to exploit china as a market for british goods britain eventually relied on its superior military capabilities to force open the lucrative chinese market while imposing an illicit trade in opium on the chinese people while china was never actually taken over by europeans many european countries such as britain and france built spheres of influence in china since china had cut itself off from the world over the previous few centuries by the qing dynasty it had fallen behind other countries in technology and was helpless to stop this from happening this had become clear when it lost the opium wars to britain in the th century in the qing dynasty was overthrown by the sun yat sen and the kuomintang a nationalist party and the republic of china established over time marxist ideas grew popular and the communist party was formed the chinese civil war later started between the kuomintang nationalists of the republic of china roc and the communists of the people s republic of china prc the communists wanted to make china like the soviet union whereas the other side wanted to keep china in its current state at the time the communists were led by mao zedong liu shaoqi and others later liu lost influence with mao and his death to this day remains unresolved the communists eventually won the war the nationalists led by chiang kai shek fled to the island of taiwan and set up their new capital city in taipei after the chinese civil war the communist leader mao zedong declared a new country the people s republic of china prc in beijing on september in the chinese civil war began as the kuomintang led by chiang kai shek and the communists fought one another amidst the turmoil brewing between the nationalist and communist parties who were vying for control of china at the time japan had launched an invasion of manchuria in and began to creep steadily inland china the nationalist party in particular owed japan immense amounts of money which they could not pay whilst infused in their own civil war the treaty of versailles promised the japanese government land in china in return for forgiveness of their debt this ended up not being a popular sentiment and was rallied against all over the country and most famously during the may th movement in beijing in when the chinese did not readily give up their rights to their land japan tried to take it by force this was the beginning of world war ii in the pacific theater by the red army of the chinese communist party had gained control over mainland china and mao zedong announced the creation of the people s republic of china chiang kai shek and the other nationalists fled to taiwan mao zedong founding the people s republic of china in as the leader of the people s republic of china mao began many social and economic reform projects with mixed results the great leap forward from to tried to industrialize china and increase its food production but resulted in one of the largest famines in history it is estimated that million people died as a result of this reform project in mao began the cultural revolution to remove capitalist influences from society and government major government officials and ordinary citizens were accused of being revisionists people who disagreed with some parts of marxism or counter revolutionaries and were persecuted many universities and schools were closed and historical and religious sites were destroyed although the program officially ended in it continued until mao s death in during this time period the people s republic of china did not get along with the capitalist countries of the western world beginning in the s relationships between the people s republic of china and the soviet union also became increasingly unfriendly in the sino soviet split in to counter the power of the soviet union mao and zhou enlai met with us president richard nixon in beijing this began to improve relationships between china and the western world after mao s death there was a power struggle between the gang of four and hua guofeng the man mao had chosen to be the next leader of china eventually deng xiaoping one of the veterans of the revolution took power he began a reform and opening up campaign these reforms tried to make the people s republic of china a modern industrial but still socialist nation by moving towards a market system deng s policies would be known as socialism with chinese characteristics although deng s policy helped loosen restrictions on citizens the people s republic of china continues to have problems with the amount of control the government has over citizens private lives in the one child policy which limits most couples to one child was created because of the overpopulation problem in the people s republic of china this policy is highly controversial and many westerners have criticized it news and internet sites are also censored by the government in the chinese government used soldiers and tanks to stop a protest in beijing s tiananmen square organized by students seeking political reform this action received worldwide criticism and led to economic sanctions being placed on the chinese government in august china hosted the summer olympics for the first time geography the people s republic of china is the third or fourth largest country in the world after russia canada and in some sources the united states and the second largest by land area china has every kind of climate in the northern hemisphere except the polar climate it is also the largest country without any land north of the arctic circle china borders nations which is more than any other country in the world it borders vietnam laos and burma in southeast asia india bhutan nepal and pakistan in south asia afghanistan tajikistan kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan in central asia a small section of russian altai and mongolia in inner asia and the russian far east and north korea in northeast asia china has two major rivers the yellow river and the yangtze river there is also the taklamakan and the gobi desert the world s highest point mt everest m is on the border between china and nepal the country s lowest point and the world s fourth lowest is the dried lake bed of ayding lake m biodiversity a giant panda photographed in sichuan china is one of megadiverse countries it is in two of the world s major ecozones the palearctic and the indomalaya in the palearctic zone mammals such as the horse camel tapir and jerboa can be found among the species in the indomalaya region are the leopard cat bamboo rat treeshrew and various monkey and ape species some overlap is between the two regions deer antelope bears wolves pigs and many rodent species can all be found in china s environments the famous giant panda is found only in a limited area along the yangtze river china has a continuing problem with trade in endangered species there are now laws to stop such activities china also has a variety of forest types cold coniferous forests cover most of the north of the country the forest have animal species such as moose and the asian black bear along with over bird species moist conifer forests can have thickets of bamboo it is replaced by rhododendrons in higher montane stands of juniper and yew subtropical forests which are mostly in central and southern china these support as many as species of flora tropical and seasonal rainforests though confined to yunnan and hainan island have a quarter of all the plant and animal species found in china military the prc armed forces also known as the people s liberation army pla is one of the most powerful armies in the world nowadays prc is among the atomic powers in the world it also has the largest standing army in the world of over million soldiers on active duty people and culture there are recognized ethnic minority groups in china han is the largest ethnic group in china mandarin chinese is the main spoken language china is the origin of eastern martial arts called kung fu or wushu china is also the home of the well respected spa monastery and wudang mountains martial art started more for the purpose of survival defense and warfare than art over time some art forms have branched off while others have retained their distinct chinese characteristics china has had renowned artists including wong fei hung and many others art has also co existed with a variety of paints including the more standard colors legendary and controversial moves like big mak are also praised and talked about within the culture china has many traditional festivals such as the chinese new year dragon boat festival mid autumn festival and so on the most significant is chinese new year another important holiday is the national day celebration around october weekends are moved around to make sure everyone has a week long holiday for it just like during the lunar new year festivals chinese new year lasts fifteen days including one week as a national holiday it starts with the first day of the chinese lunar year and ends with the full moon fifteen days later it is always in the middle of winter but is called the spring festival in chinese because chinese seasons are a little different from english ones on the first day of the chinese new year people call on friends and relatives because most people watch the special performances on cctv all the night on new year s eve and don t go to bed until am they usually get up later in the next day the fifth day of the chinese new year is the day to welcome the god of wealth chinese many people make and eat dumplings chinese pinyin jaozi they believe that dumplings can hold the god of wealth and bring luck the last day of the chinese new year is the lantern festival on this day the moon becomes the full moon people go out and watch the lantern festivals everywhere after that they eat sweet dumpling chinese a kind of dumpling which is round and looks like the full moon dragon boat festival is celebrated to commemorate the death of qu yuan a patriotic poet of the state of chu during the warring states period he persuaded his emperor not to accept qin s diplomats s offers several times but his emperor did not listen to him he was very sad and ended up jumping into the river to end his life the people loved him so much that they did not want the fish to eat his corpse they made and threw rice dumplings into the river they hope the fish eat these dumplings instead of the poet s corpse they also rowed dragon boats in the river to get rid of the fish eating rice dumplings and holding dragon boat races became what the chinese do in this festival nowadays held on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month the mid autumn festival is a festival for families now when the festival sets in people sit together to eat moon cakes appreciate the moon and the moon itself celebrate the bumper harvest and enjoy the family love and happiness to the chinese people the full moon symbolizes family reunion as do the moon cakes hence why the mid autumn festival is also called the family reunion festival transport trains are commonly used for moving from one place to another mainly for long distances bullet trains are faster and more common in the cities china has more high speed trains than any other country in the world buses and air transport are also very common related pages list of

psychological processes and the nervous and immune systems of the human body pni takes an interdisciplinary approach the main interests of pni are the interactions between the nervous and immune systems and the relationships between mental processes and health history interest in the relationship between psychiatric syndromes or symptoms and immune function has been a consistent theme since the beginning of modern medicine claude bernard a french physiologist founded the concept milieu interieur in the mid s in bernard described the perturbation of this internal state there are protective functions of organic elements holding living materials in reserve and maintaining without interruption humidity heat and other conditions indispensable to vital activity sickness and death are only a dislocation or perturbation of that mechanism bernard walter cannon a professor of physiology at harvard university coined the term homeostasis in his book the wisdom of the body in in his work with animals cannon observed that any change of emotional state in the beast such as anxiety distress or rage was accompanied by total cessation of movements of the stomach bodily changes in pain hunger fear and rage these studies into the relationship between the effects of emotions and perceptions on the autonomic nervous system the responses that led to the freeze fight or flight response birth of psychoneuroimmunology in robert ader and nicholas cohen advanced pni with a demonstration of classic conditioning of the immune function and coined the term psychoneuroimmunology ader was investigating how long conditioned responses might last in laboratory rats the highly reproducible results showed that conditioned rats exposed to the conditioned stimulus were immuno suppressed in other words a signal via the nervous system taste was affecting immune function this was one of the first scientific experiments that demonstrated that the nervous system can affect the immune system in david felten then working at the indiana university of medicine discovered a network of nerves leading to blood vessels as well as cells of the immune system the researchers also found nerves in the thymus and spleen terminating near clusters of lymphocytes macrophages and mast cells all of which help control immune function this discovery provided one of the first indications of how neuro immune interaction occurs ader cohen and felten went on to edit the groundbreaking book psychoneuroimmunology in which laid out the underlying premise that the brain and immune system represent a single integrated system of defense link between stress and disease stressors can produce profound health consequences in one epidemiological study for example all cause mortality increased in the month following a severe stressor the death of a spouse theorists propose that stressful events trigger cognitive and affective responses which in turn induce sympathetic nervous system and endocrine changes these ultimately impair immune function potential health consequences are broad but include rates of infection hiv progression and cancer incidence and progression references a political party is an organized group of people or bodies who seek to capture political power through an election in order to run the affairs of a country it often puts forward candidates for public office in a democracy leaders must run for office in an election in a dictatorship there is generally only one party allowed that can approve a new leader without non members having a choice about a political party is similar to a faction and can be the same thing in some systems members of one party in the legislature are all expected to vote the same way the laws written by the party or faction with the majority of votes become adopted by the country so this means whatever party is elected to over half the seats gets to run the government the next largest party is often called the opposition sometimes when there are more than two parties with seats no one party has over half of the seats then two or more parties might join together to form what is called a coalition some parties are formed around a single issue or interest group others form policies to address all matters of government known as a platform many political parties have a set of ideas and beliefs called its ideology people often describe these ideologies using words such as conservative and liberal common ideologies include environmentalism socialism ranging from social democracy to marxism and communism conservatism democracy liberalism and nationalism the law political parties can be against the law in some places when some parties get a lot of power they can make all other political parties illegal for example the nazi party did this in germany and the communist party did it in several countries some countries make extreme right parties illegal such as vlaams blok in belgium at other times countries have outlawed far left parties for example west germany banned the communist party in a handful of countries like china north korea and cuba still have one party dictatorships in a few other dictatorships such as saudi arabia all political parties are banned and there is no parliament at all importance in all big democracies in all big democratic countries parties are very important but there are a few very small countries such as the island of jersey where most politicians do not belong to any party and where parties do not matter much in some democracies there are only two big political parties for example in the united states there is the democratic party and the republican party some other parties exist but are very small and do not hold seats in congress in other countries there are larger numbers of parties in the german federal parliament or bundestag six parties have seats in the united kingdom there are two big parties one medium sized party and many small

not in a book etc it is a sheet or piece of paper when we talk about computers a page is also a common abbreviation in net jargon for webpage here the page is not paper it is a piece of information which we can see on a computer monitor at one time we can print it to make a real page but the information may not fit all on one page and we can not change it when it is printed we can change a web page so a webpage is not always the same even as a printed copy of that page this is a conceptual metaphor it can be confusing someone who uses it is also likely to use other jargon a page is also a boy or a young man who helps carry things and does small jobs for someone another word for this is a pageboy to page someone is to contact that person on their pager this is a small electronic machine which makes a sound or gives someone a message this is usually to call someone for a certain reason for example to call them down somewhere or to ask them for something a pet is a domesticated animal that lives with people but is not forced to work and is not eaten in most instances in most cases a pet is kept to entertain people or for companionship some pets such as dogs and cats are placed in an animal shelter if there is no one willing to take care of it if no one adopts it or the pet is too old sick the pet may be euthanized dogs cats fish rodents lagomorphs ferrets birds certain reptiles and amphibians and a wide variety of arthropods such as tarantulas and hermit crabs are the most common pets in north america horses elephants oxen and donkeys are usually made to work so they are not usually called pets some dogs also do work for people and it was once common for some birds like falcons and carrier pigeons to work for humans rodents are also very popular pets the most common are guinea pigs rabbits hamsters especially syrian and dwarf hamsters mice and rats image name x dog member of canines x cat member of felines x goldfish member of fishes x mouse member of rodents x rabbit member of hares x hamster member of rodents x guinea pig member of rodents x parrot member of birds the term program can be used in many ways a program or programme can be a plan of how to do something it tells the steps that we think we need to do to make something happen for example a government might make a program to improve the health of the people in part of a country by giving the people better food by helping to kill insects that carry diseases and by bringing more doctors a computer program is something a computer uses to work for example computer games or web browsers television program me is a show that is on television radio program is similar to a television program but it is on the radio webcast is similar to a television program but it is shown on the internet step program is a way people use to stop doing something examples would be to stop drinking alcohol stop smoking tobacco or stop using drugs an event program is a thing that lists the what will happen during an event such as an opera or auction plato the person who created the idea of platonic realism platonic realism is the theory of reality developed by plato and explained in his theory of forms platonic realism states that the visible world of particular things is a shifting exhibition like shadows cast on a wall by the activities of their corresponding universal ideas or forms whereas the visible world of particulars is unreal the forms occupy the unobservable yet true reality and are real platonism is a similar yet sometimes modified view of reality origin among the natural philosophers in ancient greece the problem of universals was the mystery of where particular things derive their traits that we perceive as universals for instance red or apple or good or woman or truth plato explained that the particular things of the visible world are imperfect transient copies of the universal ideas that are the perfect lasting forms existing exist outside space and time the forms are the universals and act as templates from which particulars manifest in his metaphysics aristotle a student of plato explained that socrates and his own student plato held it significant that the world is in flux much as heraclitus had commented you cannot step into the same river twice a theme of the eleatics a group of pre socratic philosophers influence plato s quest plato considered that only the mind could access the timeless reality of truths the realm of the forms casting the visible world plato s metaphorical allegory of the cave whereby humans only know reality as shadows of the real things they see interacting on a wall suggests the practical consequences of platonic realism as to natural philosophy in its endeavor to explain the natural world and as to values in human society value theory comprises ethics aesthetics and political philosophy plato had led the focused application of geometry developed by euclid to explain the natural world yet by his view of nature plato regarded astronomy as similar to seeking a theoretical proof in geometry abstract and not the real world whereupon the mind s insights derived from a quest to hold other truths through the mind s probing of ethics and aesthetics would yield discovery of truths within the realm of forms outside space and time aristotle s answer aristotle a student of plato answered the problem of universals differently aristotle explained that universals are concepts corresponding to traits borne and shared by the particular things themselves aristotle did not regard all reality as visible as he recognized existence of souls yet regarded souls as unobserved parts of the visible world real in itself aristotelianism largely shaped the course of western thought aristotle developed a more or less full description and explanation of the natural world and developed logic syllogistic logic to derive conclusions of the relations among things aristotle s grounding in the visible world was a metaphysical approach that suggested what evolved by some years later into empirical science platonism some mathematicians and physicists are platonists for instance max tegmark and roger penrose yet today s platonists usually view entities within the visible world as real and simply regard universal abstractions like numbers sets propositions and geometry as corresponding to real and timeless entities that also exist though pure platonists regard only the forms or their realm as real by way of string theory and the holographic principle some physicists conjecture that plato s allegory of the cave approximates the natural world s structure tegmark who regards only the mathematical structure of the universe as real has been called a radical platonist notes robert boyle s self flowing flask fills itself in this picture but perpetual motion machines cannot exist the pinocchio paradox is a variant of the liar paradox a paradox is a seemingly absurd or self contradictory statement in logic that superficially cannot be true but also cannot be false further analysis of the statement or proposition may reveal a fallacious axiom or some obscure underlying truth not all paradoxes are fundamentally incongruous as some may only appear so many famous problems of this kind exist a famous paradoxes is called the liar s paradox it is the simple sentence this sentence is a lie if the sentence is true then it is a lie as it says but if it is a lie how can it be true a lie cannot also be the truth so the sentence being true makes it a lie if the sentence is a lie then it is not as it says it is true but that is just what the sentence says so that makes it true so the sentence being a lie makes it true this paradox is not just true in english but in any language powerful enough for a sentence to make a claim about itself this is true of mathematics as well paradox can never be removed from any symbol system that makes claims about itself another example is the statement that there is no cabal only a cabal can know if there is no cabal so this is either a guess or it is a cabal trying to pretend it does not exist other famous examples xeno s paradox of motion simpson s paradox in statistics a paradox can also arise in ethics assuming power over others may sometimes be required to protect them while diminishing their right to autonomy this is defined as an ethical dilemma which means a paradox arising in ethics similarly an ethical dilemma may be resolved by re framing of the problem to reveal the false contradiction because a paradox forces us to think out of the box about possibilities other than true or false in logic right or wrong in morality it is considered very important in education people who do not see a paradox where others do are likely to be too certain they are right related pages irony oxymoron buttered cat paradox ethical dilemma a potato is a root vegetable the solanum tuberosum it is a small plant with large leaves the part of the potato that people eat is a tuber that grows under the ground a potato contains a lot of starch and other carbohydrates potato usually has a light brown or yellowish skin and is white or yellow inside if the potato gets light on it the tuber turns green and will be poisonous sprout dormant bud periderm cortex vascular ring perimedulla outer medulla history the potato is originally from the high and cool areas of the andes mountains it was grown as a food crop thousands of years ago when spanish conquistadores came to south america in the s they took potatoes back to europe it took nearly years for the potato to become a widely grown crop in the s the farmers in ireland began growing potatoes because they grew well in the poor soils they also have most of the vitamins that people need to live when a potato plague destroyed the crop in the irish potato famine killed many people the potato plant is now grown in many different parts of the world captain william bligh planted potatoes on bruny island tasmania in in australia they are now the largest vegetable crop types yukon gold developed in canada norgleam bismark coliban russet pontiac sequoia desiree cream colored flesh red skin bintje irish grown scientists in germany have used genetic engineering to make a potato called the amflora which could be grown to make starch for making other things in factories cooking potatoes are almost always eaten cooked people cook potatoes by boiling baking roasting or frying them french fries or chips are potatoes cut into long pieces and fried until they are soft potato chips often called crisps are potatoes cut into very thin round pieces and fried until they are hard william shakespeare wrote that the potato was an aphrodisiac but there is no evidence to show this is true image by clusius references green leaves and yellow flowers of a plants are one of six big groups kingdoms of living things they are autotrophic eukaryotes which means they have complex cells and make their own food usually they cannot move not counting growth plants include familiar types such as trees herbs bushes grasses vines ferns mosses and green algae the scientific study of plants known as botany has identified about extant living species of plants fungi and non green algae are not classified as plants most plants grow in the ground with stems in the air and roots below the surface some float on water the root part absorbs water and some nutrients the plant needs to live and grow these climb the stem and reach the leaves the evaporation of water from pores in the leaves pulls water through the plant this is called transpiration a plant needs sunlight carbon dioxide minerals and water to make food by photosynthesis a green in plants called chlorophyll traps the energy from the sun needed to make food chlorophyll is mostly found in leaves inside plastids which are inside the leaf cells the leaf can be thought of as a food factory leaves of plants vary in shape and size but they are always the plant organ best suited to capture solar energy once the food is made in the leaf it is transported to the other parts of the plant such as stems and roots the word plant can also mean the action of putting something in the ground for example farmers plant seeds in the field photosynthesis is a process that is taken place by the leaves on the plant the leaves are the only parts of a plant that can do this process as they adapted this is also known as how the plant gets its food you can make the process quicker by adding more co light

soil plants use the water to make food the water also provides the plant with support plants that lack water become very limp and their stems cannot support their leaves plants which specialise in desert areas are called xerophytes or phreatophytes depending on the type of root growth water is transported from the roots to the rest of the plant through special vessels in the plant when the water reaches the leaves some of it evaporates into the air many plants need the help of fungi to make their roots work properly this plant fungi symbiosis is called mycorrhiza rhizobia bacteria in root nodules help some plants get nitrogen flowering plant reproduction flowers and pollination flowers are the reproductive organ only of flowering plants angiosperms the petals of a flower are often brightly colored and scented to attract insects and other pollinators the stamen is the male part of the plant it is composed of the filament a stalk that holds the anther which produces the pollen pollen is needed for plants to produce seeds the carpel is the female part of the flower the top part of the carpel contains the stigma the style is the neck of the carpel the ovary is the swollen area at the bottom of the carpel the ovary produces the seeds the sepal is a leaf that protects a flower as a bud the process by which pollen gets transferred from one flower to another flower is called pollination this transfer can happen in different ways insects such as bees are attracted to bright scented flowers when bees go into the flower to gather nectar the spiky pollen sticks to their back legs the sticky stigma on another flower catches the pollen when the bee lands or flies nearby it some flowers use the wind to carry pollen their dangling stamens produce lots of pollen that is light enough to be carried by the wind their flowers are usually small and not highly coloured the stigmas of these flowers are feathery and hang outside the flower to catch the pollen as it falls seed travelers a plant produces many spores or seeds lower plants such as moss and ferns produce spores the seed plants are the gymnosperms and angiosperms if all the seeds fell to the ground besides the plant the area might become overcrowded there might not be enough water and minerals for all the seeds seeds usually have some way to get to new places some seeds can be dispersed by the wind or by water seeds inside juicy fruits are dispersed after being eaten sometimes seeds stick to animals and are dispersed that way fossils phylogenetic plant tree showing the major clades and traditional groups monophyletic groups are in black and paraphyletics in blue diagram according to symbiogenetic origin of plant cells and phylogeny of algae bryophytes vascular plants and flowering plants the question of the earliest plant fossils depends on what is meant by the word plant if by plants we mean phototrophs using chlorophyll then cyanobacteria in stromatolites are the first fossils million years ago mya in the archaean eon the remarkable precision is possible because the fossils were sandwiched between lava flows that could be precisely dated from embedded zircon crystals if by plants we include all types of algae then the earliest known red algae lived billion years ago fossils of them were recently found in india if by plants we mean green plants viridiplantae then the first fossils are green algae this is probably the majority position amongst professional botanists there is convincing evidence for the monophyly of charophyte green algae and embryophytes there are still two choices acritarchs a group of organic walled microfossils may be reproductive cysts of green algae if so they are present in the neoproterozoic era mya otherwise there is a large increase in planktonic algae around mya in the cambrian period if by plants we mean land plants the first fossils are in the silurian by the silurian fossils of whole plants are preserved including the lycophyte baragwanathia from the devonian detailed fossils of rhyniophytes have been found early fossils of these ancient plants show the individual cells within the plant tissue the devonian period also saw the evolution of the first tree in the fossil record wattezia this fern like tree had a trunk with fronds and produced spores the coal measures are a major source of palaeozoic plant fossils with many groups of plants in existence at this time the spoil heaps of coal mines are the best places to collect coal itself is the remains of fossilised plants though structural detail of the plant fossils is rarely visible in coal in the fossil forest at victoria park in glasgow the stumps of lepidodendron trees are found in their original growth positions related pages spore seed germination references a prediction is a statement that someone makes about what they think is going to happen it is often very helpful to know what is going to happen to help prepare for these future events predictions are based on the idea that two beginning positions that are like each other will have similar results by watching something happen it is possible to predict what will happen if something similar happens predictions are given by science or fortune tellers or horoscopes the most common example of a prediction is the weather forecast studying how weather happens lets people predict what the weather will be by looking at what is currently happening this is helpful because by knowing that it is going to rain a person can wear the right clothes for it nostradamus has made many predictions about the future in a bean machine or galton box most balls end up close to the center in the long run they will show a normal distribution probability is a part of mathematics it has to do with chance the study of things that might happen or might not happen for example using probability you can show that if you throw a coin up in the air and let it land half of the time it will land with one side facing up and half the time with the other side facing up many coins have a picture of the face of a famous person on one side and something else on the other side often people call the side with the face heads and the other side tails the probability p of an event is always between zero impossible and one certain if we roll a die plural dice then the chance that it will land on is this is because there are numbers on a die also the chance it will land on is this is because it can land on or the chance of any number between and landing is every time we roll the die it will always land on a number between and probability can be figured out using mathematics for example if you roll six dice the chance of you getting a number more than ten is not obvious but can be figured out using math and science one of the most interesting things about chance is that to figure out the probability that two things will both happen you multiply their two probabilities together for instance suppose that you want to know the probability of rolling two dice and getting a certain combination it could be two s or a then a just any two the possibility of getting a is one in six and the possibility of getting a is also one in six so the chances of getting a then a is if that number is expressed as somewhere between and it equals which is fairly low the possibility of getting a then a and then a would be or which is a much lower probability ideas of probablity people like jacob bernoulli pierre simon laplace or christiaan huygens used the word probability as described above other people thought about frequencies ther notion of probability is usually called frequency probability related pages list of mathematics topics a d diagram of the protein myoglobin showing turquoise alpha helices this protein was the first to have its structure solved by x ray crystallography towards the right center among the coils a heme group shown in grey with a bound oxygen molecule red proteins are long chain molecules built from small units known as amino acids they are joined together with peptide bonds they are biochemical compounds consisting of one or more polypeptides folded into a round or fibrous shape a polypeptide is a single linear polymer chain of amino acids the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide comes from the dna sequence of a gene the genetic code specifies standard amino acids shortly after synthesis some amino acids are chemically modified this alters the folding stability activity and function of the protein sometimes proteins have non peptide groups attached as cofactors proteins are essential to all cells like other biological macromolecules polysaccharides and nucleic acids proteins take part in virtually every process in cells many proteins are enzymes that catalyze biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism other proteins have structural or mechanical functions such as in muscle and in cells the cytoskeleton is a system of scaffolding that keeps cell shape other proteins are important in cell signalling immune responses and cell division proteins for human beings egg whites contain a lot of protein proteins have different functions depending on their shape they can be found in meat or muscle they are used for growth and repair as well as for strengthening the bones they help to make tissue and cells they are in animals plants fungi bacteria and also in the human body muscles contain a lot of protein when protein is digested it is broken down into amino acids these amino acids can then be used to build new protein proteins form an important part in foods like milk eggs meat fish beans and nuts and pulses there are four factors that determine what a protein will do the first is the order of the amino acids there are different types of amino acids the second is the little twists in the chain the third is how the entire structure is folded up the fourth is whether it is made up of different sub units haemoglobin molecules for example are made of four sub units damaging mutations most proteins are enzymes and mutations may slow them or stop them working of human cancers are caused by mutations in the tumour suppressor p p is a protein which regulates cell division essential amino acids proteins are necessary in an animal s diets since animals cannot make all the amino acids they need they can make most of them they must get certain amino acids from food these are called the essential amino acids through digestion animals break down ingested protein into free amino acids the amino acids are then used in metabolism to make the enzymes and structures the body needs there are nine essential amino acids for humans which are obtained from food the nine essential amino acids are histidine isoleucine leucine lysine methionine phenylalanine threonine tryptophan and valine meat contains all the essential amino acids humans need most plants do not however eating a mixture of plants such as both wheat and peanut butter or rice and beans provides all the essential amino acids needed soy products like tofu provide all the essential amino acids as does quinoa but these are not the only way to get the protein humans need the scientist jns jacob berzelius gave proteins their name but many other scientists have studied proteins related pages

chemical elements is a list of known chemical elements in the table the elements are placed in the order of their atomic numbers starting with the lowest number of one hydrogen the atomic number of an element is the same as the number of protons in that particular nucleus of an atom in the periodic table the elements are arranged into periods and groups a row of elements across the table is called a period each period has a number from to period has only elements in it hydrogen and helium period and period both have elements other periods are longer elements in a period have consecutive atomic numbers a column of elements down the table is called a group there are groups in the standard periodic table each group has a number from to elements in a group have electrons arranged in similar ways according to the number of valency electrons which gives them similar chemical properties they behave in similar ways for example group is known as the noble gases because they are all gases and they do not combine with other atoms there are two systems of group numbers one using arabic numerals and the other using roman numerals i ii iii the roman numeral names were used in most of the th century in the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac decided to use the new system with arabic numerals to replace the two old group systems that used roman numerals the periodic table has been used by chemists to observe patterns and relationships between elements there are main groups in in the periodic table metals metalloids and nonmetals for example elements to the bottom and far left of the table are the most metallic and elements on the top right are the least metallic e g cesium is much more metallic than helium there are also many other patterns and relationships

example the digestion of food hormones and other chemicals are made by the stomach liver and pancreas muscle contraction happens because of chemical messages made by nerves of that muscle by learning how the body functions normally physiologists and physicians can better understand what happens when organs do not function normally for example an understanding of how the thyroid gland functions has helped in treating goitre studies of the circulatory system and the nervous system have helped physicians understand and treat such illnesses like heart disease stroke and high blood pressure the

planet is a large object such as jupiter or earth that orbits a star planets are smaller than stars and they do not produce light planets are shaped like a slightly squashed ball called a spheroid objects that orbit planets are called satellites a star and everything which orbits it are called a star system there are eight planets in our solar system pluto used to be called a planet but in august the international astronomical union decided it was a dwarf planet instead there are four more known dwarf planets in the solar system ceres makemake eris and haumea the name planet is from the greek word planetes meaning wanderers or things that move until the s people only knew of those in the solar system as of june we know of other planets these newly found planets are orbiting other stars they are extrasolar planets sometimes people call them exoplanets in the solar system planets of the solar system the planets in the solar system have names of greek or roman gods apart from earth because people did not think earth was a planet in old times however earth is occasionally referred by the name of a roman god terra other languages for example chinese use different names moons also have names of gods and people from classical mythology or from the plays written by shakespeare planets here is a list of planets in the solar system they are ordered by how close they are to the

they work out of a police station police are trained in first aid and rescue because police officers are often one of the first people to get to a place where people are sick or injured such as a car accident or a fire naming a police agency may be called a police force police department police service constabulary civil guard or protective service a gendarmerie is a police force that is part of the military although its members rarely do actual military work most police forces in the united states name themselves as place police department such as new york city police department state police forces are usually known as either state highway patrol or state state police in the united kingdom most are place police or place constabulary in canada and other english speaking countries place police service is common ireland s police are called the garda sochna a law enforcement agency is any agency that enforces the law in the united states there are some law enforcement agencies that are not called police forces but carry out similar work such as the federal bureau of investigations one common type is a sheriff s office also sheriff s department an agency that is led by a sheriff those who carry out policing duties are known as police officers they may also be known as policemen men only policewomen women only peace officers constables rangers or civil guards in a sheriff s office they are known as sheriff s deputies or deputies for short in ireland they are known by the irish language word garda garda if singular or as guards powers the police have different powers to help them do their job these powers are different in different countries most police officers have the power to arrest people search people and search houses properties they sometimes carry equipment such as guns batons tasers or pepper spray the area where police officers can use these powers is called their jurisdiction if officers are outside of their jurisdiction another police force with jurisdiction can then use their powers duties the police deal with preventing crime and protecting the public they do this by patrolling on foot in uniform and in police cars this can stop some forms of criminal behavior responding to crimes when someone calls the police to say that a crime is happening they must send some police officers to arrive at the scene very quickly they will try to stop the crime and catch the person doing it investigating crime this means that the police try to find out who did the crime arresting and detaining suspects when the police believe that someone has committed a crime the police arrest them take them to the police station and ask them questions however it is the prosecutors and not the police who have the final say on whether a suspect gets charged to help with emergencies or problems that are not crimes this may be car accidents fires or people who are sick hurt or lost the police work with firefighters ambulances and rescuers they might direct traffic help lost children or give traffic tickets parts of police departments most police departments have officers in two main groups a patrol group with officers who wear uniforms and a detective group with officers who wear normal clothing patrol officers travel through their area they may travel by foot on bicycle or motorcycle or in marked cars the cars have warning lights and sirens that can be used the sirens make a loud sound patrol officers enforce motor vehicle and criminal laws in some locations patrol officers manage the local jail detectives work on investigations that are more complex they try to find fraud illegal drugs and sex crimes like prostitution human trafficking and rape prostitution is not a crime in all countries not all countries use the same words to describe these groups in the united kingdom for example patrol officers form the uniform branch while detectives work within the cid criminal investigation department police uniforms equipment and methods vary depending on the country in some places groups of police train for special jobs such as dealing with riots or dealing with highly dangerous criminals polish police officer with some of his equipment police in different countries different countries have different ways of organizing their police some countries like south africa ireland and new zealand have just one police force other countries have more than one france has two police forces one for cities and another for rural areas chile also has two one for patrol and another for investigations some countries have two or more levels of police forces for example most policing in australia is carried out by the six state police forces but there is also the australian federal police who police the whole country germany has a similar system the united kingdom and switzerland have many local police forces and several national agencies but no actual national police force in canada local governments can choose to either run their own police force or give the job to a bigger one so most canadian cities have their own police while most rural areas are policed by the royal canadian mounted police which is also the national police the united states has over law enforcement agencies many areas have four levels of law enforcement agencies for example los angeles has the los angeles police department but there are many other agencies that can work in the city this includes the county level los angeles sheriff s department the state level california highway patrol and over federal or national law enforcement agencies worldwide police are a small percentage of the number of people they serve on average there are police officers per people spanish police car equipment in most countries police officers carry guns during their normal duties in the united kingdom new zealand ireland and a few other countries most police officers do not carry guns officers communicate using radio devices the radios can be on both the uniform and in the patrol vehicle related pages police officer swat team references other websites picture of san fransico police man police history book police pictures links pi is equal to the circumference divided by the diameter x pi is an endless string of numbers pi or is a mathematical constant it is the ratio of the distance around a circle to the circle s diameter this produces a number and that number is always the same however the number is rather strange the number starts as and continues without end numbers like this are called irrational numbers the diameter is the longest straight line which can be fitted inside a circle it passes through the center of the circle the distance around a circle is known as the circumference even though the diameter and circumference are different for different circles the number pi remains constant its value never changes this is because the relationship between the circumference and diameter is always the same approximation a diagram showing how can be found by using a circle with a diameter of one the circumference of this circle is pi is often written formally as or the greek letter as a shortcut pi is also an irrational number meaning it cannot be written as a fraction where a and b are integers whole numbers this basically means that the digits of pi that are to the right of the decimal go forever without repeating in a pattern and that it is impossible to write the exact value of pi as a number pi can only be approximated or measured to a value that is close enough for practical purposes a value close to pi is a common fraction approximation of pi is which yields approximately this approximation is away from the true value of pi while this approximation is accepted for most of its use in real life the fraction is more accurate giving about and can be used when a value closer to pi is needed computers can be used to get better approximations of pi in march emma haruka iwao calculated the value of pi to trillion digits history the value of pi was known to ancient indian mathematicians like bhaskaracharya and aryabhatta mathematicians have known about pi for thousands of years because they have been working with circles for the same amount of time civilizations as old as the babylonians have been able to approximate pi to many digits such as the fraction and most historians believe that ancient egyptians had no concept of and that the correspondence is a coincidence the first written reference to pi dates to around the egyptian ahmes gave a value in the rhind papyrus the babylonians were able to find that the value of pi was slightly greater than by simply making a big circle and then sticking a piece of rope onto the circumference and the diameter taking note of their distances and then dividing the circumference by the diameter knowledge of the number pi passed back into europe and into the hands of the hebrews who made the number important in a section of the bible called the old testament after this the most common way of trying to find pi was to draw a shape of many sides inside any circle and use the area of the shape to find pi the greek philosopher archimedes for example used a polygon shape that had sides in order to find the value of pi but the chinese in were able to use a polygon with sides to find the value of pi the greeks like anaxagoras of clazomenae were also busy with finding out other properties of the circle such as how to make squares of circles and squaring the number pi since then many people have been trying to find out more and more exact values of pi a history of pi philosopher date approximation claudius ptolemy around zu chongzhi al khwarizmi around al kashi around vite roomen van ceulen around in the th century better and better ways of finding pi became available such as the complicated formula that the french lawyer franois vite developed the first use of the greek symbol was in an essay written in by william jones a mathematician named lambert also showed in that the number pi was irrational that is it cannot be written as a fraction by normal standards another mathematician named lindeman was also able to show in that pi was part of the group of numbers known as transcendentals which are numbers that cannot be the solution to a polynomial equation pi can also be used for figuring out many other things beside circles the properties of pi have allowed it to be used in many other areas of math besides geometry which studies shapes some of these areas are complex analysis trigonometry and series pi in real life today there are different ways to calculate many digits of this is of limited use though pi can sometimes be used to work out the area or the circumference of any circle to find the circumference of a circle use the formula c circumference times diameter to find the area of a circle use the formula radius this formula is sometimes written as where r is the variable for the radius of any circle and a is the variable for the area of that circle to calculate the circumference of a circle with an error of mm digits are needed for a radius of meters digits for a radius equal to that of the earth digits for a radius equal to the distance from the earth to the sun people generally celebrate march as pi day because march is also written as which represents the first three numbers in the approximation of pi pi day started during related pages circle references a proper noun or proper name is a noun representing a unique thing such as london jupiter john hunter or toyota as opposed to a common noun which represents a class of things for example city planet person or corporation proper nouns are the only nouns in english which have the first letter capitalized in english proper nouns are not normally preceded by an article or other limiting modifier such as any or some and are used to denote a particular person place or object without regard to any descriptive meaning the word or phrase may have for example a town called newtown may be but does not necessarily have to be a new recently built town which nouns are considered proper names depends on language for example names of days and months are considered proper names in english but not in spanish french swedish slovenian or finnish where they are not capitalized references these objects are all made out of plastic amber a naturally occurring plastic a plastic is a material that can change its shape many things are made of plastics usually because making them the right shape is easy there are many types of plastic some can be shaped only when they are freshly made then they become hard others are thermoplastic and can be softened by heating them these plastics can be used for d printing because the plastic will become soft enough to form into different shapes and then become hard again when they cool down most plastics are man made they do not occur in nature the process of making plastics is usually quite complicated most of the materials that are called plastic are polymers polymers are long chains of atoms bonded to each other in most plastics the long chain is a chain of carbon atoms with other atoms attached to them the different atoms and the shape and length of the chains change how the plastic looks and works people experimented with plastics based on natural polymers for a very long time alexander parkes an english inventor created early form of plastic in it was hard but flexible and transparent he called it parkesine but now it is called celluloid old plastics are usually thrown away and put in landfills some plastics release toxic fumes when heated some plastics are recycled so they won t become waste some plastics have other materials added to them like glass because they make the plastic stronger and stiffer plastics are mostly petrochemicals made from natural gas or from petroleum a type of oil chemical engineers refine the petroleum which goes through a heating process it develops ethylene and propylene which are the chemical building blocks for many plastics these chemicals are then combined with other chemicals to produce a polymer today some of these plastics are also being made without oil instead other sources like plants and bacteria are used to make the plastic these plastics are called bioplastics they are useful because they can be eaten by other bacteria instead of throwing them away well known plastics and their use polyamide usually called nylon women s stockings gears car parts toothbrush bristles polycarbonate bulletproof glass compact discs dvds polyethylene tubes bottles shopping bags milk jugs body armor made with polyethylene with especially long chains polyethylene terephtalate called pet when used for bottles and polyester when used for clothes or other materials polypropylene food containers chairs polystyrene cd cases plastic cups plastic forks and knives polyurethane rubber foam shiny coatings on wood and tile polyvinyl chloride called pvc usually pipes chemicals can make pvc softer for toys and cushions product stewardship includes waste disposal measures in the distribution of an industrial product that is paying for the safe and proper disposal when you pay for the product and relying on those who sold it to you to dispose of it the slightly more specific idea of product take back means that the service of waste disposal is paid for at time of purchase it is often applied to paint tires and other goods that become toxic waste if not disposed of properly it is most familiar as the deposit bottle where one pays for the loan of the bottle at the same time as one purchases what is inside it the container deposit charged for a deposit bottle may be a fee to buy the bottle separately from the fee to buy what it contains if one returns the bottle the fee is returned and the supplier must return the bottle for re use or recycling if not one has paid the fee and presumably this can pay for landfill or litter control measures that dispose of say a broken bottle also since the same fee can be collected by anyone finding and returning the bottle it is common for people to collect these and return them as a means of surviving this is quite common for instance among homeless people legal requirements vary the bottle itself may be considered simple property of the purchaser of the contents or the purchaser may have some obligation to return the bottle to some depot so it can be recycled or re used for the more toxic items it is more likely that returning it is required this principle is applied very broadly beyond bottles to paint and automobile parts such as tires when purchasing paint or tires in many places one simultaneously pays for the disposal of the toxic waste they become in some countries such as germany law requires attention to the comprehensive outcome of the whole extraction production distribution use and waste of a product and holds those profiting from these legally responsible for any outcome along the way this is also the trend in the uk and eu generally in the united states there have been many class action suits that are effectively product stewardship liability holding companies responsible for things the product does which it was never advertised to do rather than let liability for these problems be taken up by the public sector or be haphazardly assigned one issue at a time to companies via lawsuits many accounting reform efforts focus on achieving full cost accounting this is the financial reflection of the comprehensive outcome noting the gains and losses to all parties involved not just those investing or purchasing such moves have made moral purchasing more attractive as it avoids liability and future lawsuits so these are partial implementations of a strict service economy ideal those who advocate these measures are concerned with the later phases of product lifecycle and the comprehensive outcome of the whole production process it is considered a pre requisite to a strict service economy interpretation of fictional national legal commodity and product relationships peace is a time without any fights or wars in a larger sense peace or peacefulness can mean a state of harmony quiet or calm that is not disturbed by anything at all like a still pond with no ripples many people and organizations want peace one organization that was set up to bring peace among the nations and try to make war a thing of the past was the league of nations after world war i when it did not stop world war ii it was replaced by the united nations which tries to make the world peaceful this means that if any member is attacked or invaded by another country without attacking that country first the other members will come to help the country that was attacked first this idea was used by the united nations to defend both south korea and kuwait when they were attacked martin luther king jr wrote in a letter he sent from the birmingham jail that true peace is not merely the absence of tension it is the presence of justice in other words real peace is more than just problems being gone there must be fairness to have peace alfred nobel created an annual award the nobel peace prize for the person who had done the most to bring peace to the world religious beliefs and peace justice and peace shall kiss refers to psalm buddhists think that peace can be gotten once all suffering ends to get rid of suffering and get this peace many try to follow a set of teachings called the four noble truths jews and christians believe that true peace comes from a personal relationship with god jesus christ also called the prince of peace in the book of isaiah said peace i leave with you my peace i give you i do not give to you as the world gives do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid inner peace inner peace or peace of mind refers to a state of being mentally and spiritually at peace with enough knowledge and understanding to keep oneself strong in the face of stress being at peace is considered by many to be healthy and the opposite of being stressed or anxious peace of mind is generally associated with bliss and happiness peace of mind serenity and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress in some cultures inner peace is considered a state of consciousness or enlightenment that may be cultivated by various forms of training such as prayer meditation tai chi chuan or yoga for example many spiritual practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself movements and activism peace movement a movement that seeks to get ideals such as the ending of a particular war minimize inter human violence in a particular place or type of situation often linked to the goal of achieving world peace means to achieve these ends usually include advocacy of pacifism non violent resistance conscientious objector diplomacy boycotts moral purchasing supporting anti war political candidates demonstrations and lobbying to create legislation on human rights or of international law theories on peace many different theories of peace exist in the world of peace studies which involves the study of conflict transformation the definition of peace can vary with religion culture or subject of study peace is a state of balance and understanding in yourself and between others where respect is gained by the acceptance of differences tolerance persists conflicts are resolved through dialog people s rights are respected and their

ritualized there are many different religions each with a different set of beliefs the beliefs are about the world and the people in it about how they came into being and what their purpose is these beliefs according to some religious sects are often linked to supernatural beings such as god a number of gods or spirits they may also be linked to an idea such as a path that the spirit of each person should take towards goodness truth and duty this they called spirituality each religion has different ideas about these things each religion also has a moral code which is a set of beliefs about how humans should act each religion usually has their own type of devotions when people worship or pray they often have rituals special things that are always done in the same way for certain times of the year or certain times of a person s life other words that are used for religion are faith and belief system altogether followers of religion can be known as believers or the faithful few people follow more than one religion at a time the largest religions are christianity islam hinduism buddhism taoism sikhism judaism and jainism there are many other religions people who do not believe in any gods are called atheists people who say that there is no evidence are called agnostics religious beliefs god statue of saint peter holding the keys of the kingdom of heaven gospel of matthew in many religions one of the main beliefs is that there is a deity or god who is a great creator spirit in many religions there is just one deity that the people believe in in other religions there are many deities who each have different roles in the universe in many religions there are other types of spirits these may include angels devils and other such things which can be both good and bad giving honour to god the gods or the spirits is an important part of most religions while this may often be done privately it is also often done with gatherings of people and rituals these rituals are often based on old traditions and may have been done in almost the same way for hundreds or even thousands of years mother teresa of calcutta was known for her christian kindness human spirit another main belief is that humans have a soul or spirit which lives on after their body has died the person s spirit is on a journey through life that continues after death most religions believe that what a person does during their lifetime will affect what happens to their spirit in the afterlife many religions teach that a good person s spirit can reach a special place of peace and happiness such as heaven or nirvana and that a bad person s spirit can travel to a place of pain and suffering such as hell still other religions believe in reincarnation that instead of going either to heaven or hell spirits of the dead return to earth in a new body morality morals are the way a human behaves to other humans most religions make rules about human morals the rules of how people should act to each other are different in different religions for some religions following a path of goodness truth and duty is very important this is called tao in china in the teachings of judaism people were told to love your neighbour as yourself in the teachings of jesus people were told to think of every single person as their neighbour and treat them with love not every religion teaches people to be kind to all other people in many religions it has been common for people to believe that they have to act kindly only to some people and not to others in some religions people believed that they could please a god by killing or sacrificing another person traditions the man on the left is teaching others about his religion teaching a religion is passed on from one person to another through teachings and stories which are often called myths which may be written down like the bible or told from memory like the dreamtime stories of australian aboriginal people in many religions there are people who take the role of priest and spend their lives teaching others about the religion there are also people who take the role of pastor and spend their life caring for other people a person may be both a priest and a pastor they are called by different names in different religions symbols symbols are used to remind people of their religious beliefs they are also used or worn as a sign to other people that the person belongs to a particular religion a symbol might be something that is drawn or written it might be a piece of clothing or jewellery it might be a sign that a person makes with their body or it might be a building or monument or artwork picture symbols for different religions are shown in the box in the introduction to this article witness and conversion in many religions it is thought important that people should show other people that they are following a particular religion this might be done in a general way by wearing a symbol or a type of clothing many people believe that it is important to tell other people about their religion so that they can believe as well this is called witnessing these sikhs in canada wear a head dress of turban or head scarf as a symbol and witness to their religion there are many ways to witness a young person might simply say to their friends i do not use drugs or get drunk because of my religion this is a witness a person may tell their classmates workmates and friends about their beliefs a person might go to other people s houses and talk about their beliefs or invite the people to join in the rituals of the religion such as going to church or to a religious festival a person might have printed material such as books or leaflets that they give to other people to read a person might travel to a different country to teach to work in a health service or to help people in some other way people who do this are called missionaries these are different ways that people witness to their religion when a person hears a witness and decides that they will join the religion this is called a conversion usually a person decides to join a religion because they like what they have read or been told and they believe that they are hearing the truth they join the religion because they choose however throughout history there have been many times when people have been forced to join a religion by violence and threats this is still happening today in most countries of the world people are free to belong to whatever religion they choose this is generally thought of as a basic human right however there are parts of the world where it is illegal against the law to witness to any religion except the one accepted by the government of the country people who belong to other religions may be threatened put in jail or murdered carmelite nun meditating on the bible ritual rituals are an important part of the tradition of many religions in many religions it is the tradition for people to meet for a celebration on one day in every week there are also major celebrations that may be held only at certain times of the year for example on the birthday of a person who is honoured in that religion some religions have celebrations for different seasons of the year or when the sun or moon is in a certain part of the sky in nearly every religion the important stages of a person s life have a religious celebration birth naming reaching an age to think for oneself reaching adulthood marriage childbirth sickness and death are all celebrated by some religions having a celebration or special traditions when a person dies is very common it is the traditions that are about death that give the earliest evidence of religious beliefs scientists have discovered that years ago neanderthal people started burying their dead early homo sapiens put tools and other things into graves with the bodies as if they could use them in the afterlife from years ago many of the objects in graves are small artworks scientists believe that these objects were put there for religious reasons anglican groups and institutions an institution is one name for an organization many religions have organizations that manage the way that people who follow the religion are to act the organization might employ religious leaders educate people into the ideas of the religion manage money own buildings and make rules many religions have sub groups which are called denominations in islam for example there is ahmadiyya sunnism shi ism and sufism buildings a jewish man reads the psalms of david at the western wall jerusalem most religions have special buildings where people meet they are often called temples in judaism they are called synagogues in christianity they are called churches in islam they are called mosques in buddhism there are pagodas temples and monasteries in hinduism they are called mandirs people often try to make their religious building as beautiful as possible some religious buildings are great works of architecture art and music people often make artworks that are about their religion or that are used in religious celebration or are put in a religious building religious art comes in all shapes and sizes from tiny pieces of jewellery to huge statues and paintings artworks often give important clues to historians about different ancient religions that are not well understood

octavian became the emperor augustus till it fell in ce marking the end of the ancient world and the beginning of the middle ages or dark ages the empire was the third stage of ancient rome rome was first ruled by roman kings then by the roman republic then by an emperor many modern lands were once part of the roman empire for example britain not scotland spain portugal france gaul italy greece turkey germany egypt levant crimea switzerland and the north coast of africa the main language of the roman empire was latin greek was an important secondary language the western part of the roman empire continued for about years and the eastern part with greece and anatolia continued for about a thousand years more the eastern part was called the byzantine empire its capital being constantinople governing the empire in order to control their large empire the romans developed important ideas about law and government they developed the best army in the world at that time and ruled by force they had fine engineering and built roads cities and outstanding buildings the empire was divided into provinces each with a governor plus civil and military support letters both official and private would constantly go to and from rome trade was most important for rome a city of more than a million people by far the largest city in the world they needed and got wheat from egypt tin from britannia grapes from gaul and so on in return the romans built provincial capitals into fine cities protected them from raids by barbarians and provided education and career opportunities for young people in the provinces such as jobs in the roman army in principle emperors had absolute control and could do as they pleased in practice they faced many difficult problems they had a staff of what we call civil servants and the advice of the roman senate the emperor had to decide what were the most important issues facing the empire and what should be done about them most of them tried to do two sorts of thing one was to do things to improve the life of romans in peacetime the other was to fight and defeat rome s enemies a wealthy empire always has enemies with kings and emperors a big problem is the order of succession kings were sometimes followed by their eldest son if he was capable of ruling for roman emperors more often it would be an adopted son it worked like this the emperor would notice an outstanding young man from one of the best families he would adopt him as his son before he died he would make clear whom he thought should succeed him by making him a roman consul or by stating in his will that the younger man should succeed him sometimes this worked sometimes it did not every now and then there would be a civil war between claimants to the throne an adopted son or two gave the emperor more choices some emperors had no son somehad sons who were killed in battle or died during a plague later on emperors grew so weak that the roman army would just pick one of their generals to be the next emperor this often led to civil war the life stories of the emperors can be found in list of roman emperors the romans fought many wars against other countries and enjoyed watching violent sports they enjoyed watching races between chariots pulled by horses and fights between men using weapons gladiators unlike in modern sports the fighters were often killed in fights romans enjoyed these shows in the colosseum the romans had great civil engineering they built many large public buildings and villas aqueducts to carry water stone bridges and roads some of these things can still be seen today many famous writers were romans including cicero and virgil the new testament of the bible tells about the romans in the life of jesus christ during jesus life the romans who were pagans ruled his country later several emperors tried to destroy christianity but they did not succeed by the emperor galerius allowed people freedom to follow christianity and the next year a general constantine became emperor and converted to christianity the city of rome was taken over several times by barbarians notably in when the goths sacked the city looting the last western roman emperor romulus augustus resigned in the roman empire would last another years as the byzantine empire in the east the main coin of the roman empire was the silver denarius later denarii were smaller various reasons have been given for the fall of rome edward gibbon wrote a long book called the decline and fall of the roman empire in which he said it was because the romans didn t care enough to fight hard anymore other historians blame the unstable system of leadership in a year period only out of emperors died a natural death most of the emperors were assassinated references other websites an old map of the roman empire in ad bbc romans for children website on ancient rome for children at the level of primary school rome unleashed interactive educational website on ancient rome for students a regime is the leader and other people who run a government of a sovereign state there are many kinds of regimes they can achieve power in many ways depending on the time and place and local civics like the electoral system they can lose power in many ways too the most common way for a regime to lose power was a coup invasion or revolution until the th century after that it became very dangerous and difficult to use these methods peaceful regime change is usually by an election this method is now used by more than half the people on the earth it is called representative democracy such regimes are often called administration s to make it clear they are not dictators and since the executive branch does not have all the power itself it may share it with a legislative branch also the judicial branch is separate the courts are not usually considered part of the regime however some things are the same no matter how the regime achieved power the regime needs help among people outside the regime and government to stay in power these may be in the military or a political party military and police obey the regime s orders and can kill people if they would not do so then it would be possible to change regimes by force trade and tax is set by the regime which can take money away the regime speaks for the whole country when dealing with other countries when many regimes negotiate at the united nations or world trade organization it does not matter at all how each regime got its power it matters only that they can agree and make everyone in their country do as the agreement says when someone wants a regime to change in another country they usually are not able to do this by any means other than violence or interfering in its election this is common if a regime is threatened by another regime the river thames in london england people have lived along the banks of this river for thousands of years a river is a stream of

describe what is heard when sound waves pass through a medium to the ear all sounds are made by vibrations of molecules through which the sound travels for instance when a drum or a cymbal is struck the object vibrates these vibrations make air molecules move sound waves move away from their source where they came from traveling on the air molecules when the vibrating air molecules reach our ears the eardrum vibrates too the bones of the ear vibrate in the same way that of the object that started the sound wave these vibrations let you hear different sounds even music is vibrations irregular vibrations are noise people can can make very complex sounds we use them for speech sound waves are longitudinal waves with two parts compression and rarefaction compression is the part of the sound waves where the molecules of air are pushed compressed together rarefaction is the part of the waves where the molecules are far away from each other sound waves are a sequence of compression and rarefaction the speed of sound sound waves can travel through solids liquids and gases but they cannot travel through a vacuum a place with nothing in it this is why astronauts cannot talk to each other in space they need a radio to hear each other sound can travel through water faster than through air and even faster in solids like stone iron and steel sound travels at metres feet per second in the air pitch and intensity pitch is the highness or lowness of sound pitch is how humans hear different frequencies frequency is determined by the number of vibrations per second the highest key on a piano for instance vibrates times per second it has a frequency of hertz hz or kilohertz khz lower keys have lower frequencies a note an octave higher than another note has twice the frequency of that note the intensity of a sound is how much sound energy goes through a square meter in one second sound waves with higher amplitude bigger vibration have higher intensity the intensity of a sound is higher closer to the sound source farther away it s less intense the inverse square law shows how sound intensity becomes smaller farther from the source inverse square says that when distance gets multiplied by a number sound intensity gets divided by that number squared the number times itself thus twice the distance means a quarter the intensity sound intensities can be very different they can range from which are barely heard to w m painfully loud the decibel scale makes sound intensity numbers easier to work with a w m intensity is db decibels when the decibel number increases by the intensity is ten times as much so a w m intensity is db loudness is how people sense the intensity of sound loudness depends on sound intensity sound frequency and the person s hearing heard and not seen audible sound has frequencies between hz to khz human beings can hear audible sound sound waves with frequency above khz are called ultrasound waves sound waves with frequency below hz are called infrasound waves human beings cannot hear ultrasound waves and infrasound waves but some animals like bats and dolphins use them older people have an even smaller hearing range people are best at hearing sounds between hz and hz the doppler effect when a sound source is moving towards someone the frequency seems to increase the same thing happens when someone moves toward the sound source frequency seems to decrease when someone moves away from a sound source it also seems to decrease when the sound source moves away from someone this is called the doppler effect references halpern alvin erich erlbach beginning physics ii waves electromagnetism optics and modern physics pg other websites conversion of sound units and levels sound calculations society is the term to describe human beings together collective the sum of their social networks and social interactions the term comes from the latin idea of societas or the connection between friends or allies friend or ally

about the natural world natural sciences include physics chemistry biology geology and astronomy science uses mathematics and logic which are sometimes called formal sciences natural science makes observations and experiments science produces accurate facts scientific laws and theories modern science is a discovery as well as an invention it was a discovery that nature generally acts regularly enough to be described by laws and even by mathematics and required invention to devise the techniques abstractions apparatus and organization for exhibiting the regularities and securing their law like descriptions science also refers to the large amount of knowledge that has been found using this process research uses the scientific method scientific research uses hypotheses based on ideas or earlier knowledge which can be categorized through different topics then those hypotheses are tested by experiments people who study and research science and try to find out everything about it are called scientists scientists study things by looking at them very carefully by measuring them and by doing experiments and tests scientists try to explain why things act the way they do and predict what will happen scientific method today science usually refers to a way of pursuing knowledge not just the knowledge itself it is mainly about the phenomena of the material world in the th and th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of laws of nature such as newton s laws of motion and over the course of the th century the word science became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself as a way to study the natural world including physics chemistry geology and biology it was in the th century also that the term scientist was created by william whewell he meant it to distinguish those who sought knowledge on nature from those who sought other types of knowledge the scientific method is the name given to the methods used by scientists to find knowledge the main features of the scientific method are scientists identify a question or a problem about nature some problems are simple such as how many legs do flies have and some are very deep such as why do objects fall to the ground next scientists investigate the problem they work at it collecting facts sometimes all it takes is to look carefully some questions cannot be answered directly then scientists suggest ideas and test them out they do experiments and collect data eventually they figure out what they think is a good answer to the problem then they tell people about it later other scientists may agree or not agree they may suggest another answer they may do more experiments anything in science might be revised if we find out the previous solution was not good enough an example a famous example of science in action was the expedition led by arthur eddington to principe island in africa in he went there to record the positions of stars around the sun during a solar eclipse the observation of star positions showed that the apparent star positions close to the sun were changed in effect the light passing the sun was pulled towards the sun by gravitation this confirmed predictions of gravitational lensing made by albert einstein in the general theory of relativity published in eddington s observations were considered to be the first solid evidence in favour of einstein s theory had the observations resulted differently this would have counted against einstein s theory and perhaps refuted it shown it was wrong practical impacts of scientific

artificial polymers for numerous applications in industry and daily life antibiotics s salvarsan penicillin doxycycline etc nuclear magnetic resonance s nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy magnetic resonance imaging functional magnetic resonance imaging s other features of science not everyone completely agrees about how science works some philosophers and scientists say that scientific theories are only accepted for the time being they last so long as they are the best explanation when theories no longer explain the data they are discarded and replaced or sometimes scientists will make a theory better rather than discard it or they will keep on using the theory hoping that it will be made better eventually science is a way to get knowledge by discarding what is not true scientists must be very careful to make explanations that fit well with what they observe and measure they compete to provide better explanations an explanation might be interesting or pleasing but if it does not agree with what other scientists really see and measure they will try to find a better explanation before a scientific article is published other scientists read the article and decide whether the explanations make sense from the data this is called peer review after articles are published other scientists will also check if the same experiments observations or tests produce the same data again peer review and repeating experiments are the only way to be sure the knowledge is correct science makes models of nature models of our universe and medicine there are many different sciences with their own names however it is not right to say science says any one thing science is a process not just the facts and rules believed at one time some types of science natural sciences

sausage that first came from italy the name comes from the italian salare meaning to make something salty the original salami was made from a mix of chopped pork and salt which was dried using air in a casing people who are muslim are not allowed to eat this type of salami because it is pork now there are many types of salamis made in some countries nearly all are seasoned with a combination of herbs and spices in addition to salt salamis are now sometimes smoked or cooked before air drying some kinds are made of beef while others mix beef and pork most if not all italian salamis have garlic in them but few german kinds do for example some like a few salamis from spain include paprika or chili the difference between some types is in how coarse or fine the meat is chopped some light salami might add turkey or chicken to reduce both fat and calories many salamis are named after the city or region where they come from some examples are arles genoese hungarian and milano salamis special

trouble understanding the slang of younger people on the other hand younger people often understand but find silly or old fashioned the slang of older people over time language tends to get more complex since new words enter much faster than old words leave over time slang almost always becomes part of the language and approved for use by all it has also happened that some words used in anglo saxon for bodily functions became thought of as profanity or rude after they were replaced by latinate words like urinate defecate and copulate which polite people were supposed to use after the norman conquest of england in this was in part a way of making poor people who spoke anglo saxon all appear to be rude while more powerful people who spoke norman appeared to be polite one way that etiquette can develop and reinforce power structure this is only one example from history of how racism can be a reason for defining one group s language as slang and another as correct wanting to have rules of grammar that do not change and the same vocabulary used by everyone for better communication is another reason that is often given for defining one group s language as correct an idiom

multiplication division mathematics string theory is a set of attempts to model the four known fundamental interactions gravitation electromagnetism strong nuclear force weak nuclear force together in one theory this tries to resolve the alleged conflict between classical physics and quantum physics by elementary units the one classical force gravity and a new quantum field theory of the other three fundamental forces einstein had sought a unified field theory a single model to explain the fundamental interactions or mechanics of the universe today s search is for a unified field theory that is quantized and that explains matter s structure too this is called the search for a theory of everything toe the most prominent contender as a toe is string theory converted into superstring theory with its six higher dimensions in addition to the four common dimensions d time some superstring theories seem to come together on a shared range of geometry that according to string theorists is apparently the geometry of space the mathematical framework that unifies the multiple superstring theories upon that shared geometrical range is m theory many string theorists are optimistic that m theory explains our universe s very structure and perhaps explains how other universes if they exist are structured as part of a greater multiverse m theory supergravity theory has higher dimensions d background introductions to string theory that are designed for the general public must first explain physics some of the controversies over string theory result from misunderstandings about physics a common misunderstanding even among scientists is the presumption that a theory is proved true in its explanation of the natural world wherever its predictions are successful another misconception is that earlier physical scientists including chemists have already explained the world a misconception suggesting that string theorists began generating strange hypotheses once they became unaccountably set free from truth classical realm newtonian physics newton s law of universal gravitation ug added to the three galilean laws of motion and some other presumptions was published in newton s theory successfully modeled interactions among objects of observable size a range of phenomena now called the classical realm coulomb s law modeled electric attraction maxwell s electromagnetic field theory unified electricity and magnetism while optics emerged from this field light s speed remained approximately constant when measured by an observer traveling in its field however although addition of velocities predicted the field to be slower or faster relative to the observer traveling with or against it so versus the electromagnetic field the observer s speed was continually lost still no violation of galilean invariance whereby the laws of mechanics proceed identically for all objects exhibiting inertia was observed by law of inertia when no force is applied to an object the object holds its velocity which is speed and direction an object either in uniform motion which is constant speed in an unchanging direction or staying at rest which is zero velocity experiences inertia and thereby exhibits galilean invariance its mechanical interactions proceeding without variation also called galilean relativity since one cannot perceive whether one is at rest or in uniform motion relativity theory special relativity in einstein s special theory of relativity explained the accuracy of both maxwell s electromagnetic field and galilean relativity by stating that the field s speed is absolute a universal constant whereas both space and time are local phenomena relative to the object s energy thus an object in relative motion shortens along the direction of its momentum lorentz contraction and its unfolding of events slows time dilation a passenger on the object cannot detect the change as all measuring devices aboard that vehicle have experienced length contraction and time dilation only an external observer experiencing relative rest measures the object in relative motion to be shortened along its travel pathway and its events slowed special relativity left newton s theory which states space and time as absolute unable to explain gravitation by the equivalence principle einstein inferred that being under either gravitation or constant acceleration are indistinguishable experiences that might share a physical mechanism the suggested mechanism was progressive length contraction and time dilation a consequence of the local energy density within d space establishing a progressive tension within a rigid object relieving its tension by moving toward the location of greatest energy density special relativity would be a limited case of a gravitational field special relativity would apply when the energy density across d space is uniform and so the gravitational field is scaled uniformly from location to location why an object experiences no acceleration and thus no gravitation general relativity in einstein s general theory of relativity newly explained gravitation with d spacetime modeled as a lorentzian manifold time is one dimension merged with the three space dimensions as every event in d space d horizontally and d vertically entails a point along a d time axis even in everyday life one states or implies both one says or at least means meet me at building main street intersecting franklin street in apartment d on october at pm by omitting or missing the time coordinate one arrives at the correct location in space when the sought event is absent it is in the past or future at perhaps pm or am by converging space and time and presuming both relative to the energy density in the vicinity and by setting the only constant or absolute as not even mass but as light speed in a vacuum general relativity revealed the natural world s previously unimagined balance and symmetry every object is always moving at light speed along a straight line its equivalent on a curved surface called geodesic or worldline the one pathway of least resistance like a free fall through d spacetime whose geometry curves in the vicinity of mass energy an object at light speed in a vacuum is moving at maximal rate through d space but exhibits no evolution of events it is frozen in time whereas an object motionless in d space flows fully along d time experiencing the maximal rate of events unfolding the displayed universe is relative to a given location yet once the mass energy in that vicinity is stated einstein s equations predict what is occurring or did occur or will occur anywhere in the universe the popularized notion that relative in einstein s theory suggests subjective or arbitrary was to some regret of einstein who later thought he ought have to named it general theory cosmology the electromagnetic field s messenger particles photons carry an image timelessly across the universe while observers within this field have enough flow through time to decode this image and react by moving within d space yet can never outrun this timeless image the universe s state under years after the presumed big bang that began our universe is thought to be displayed as the cosmic microwave background cmb in the universe was thought to be entirely what we now call the milky way galaxy and to be static einstein operated his recently published equations of the gravitational field and discovered the consequence that the universe was expanding or shrinking the theory is operable in either direction time invariance he revised the theory add a cosmological constant to arbitrarily balance the universe nearing edwin hubble s telescopic data interpreted through general relativity revealed the universe was expanding in while on a world war i battlefield karl schwarzschild operated einstein s equations and the schwarzschild solution predicted black holes decades later astrophysicists identified a supermassive black hole in the center of perhaps every galaxy black holes seem to lead galaxy formation and maintenance by regulating star formation and destruction in the s it was noticed that according to general relativity galaxies would fall apart unless surrounded by invisible matter holding a galaxy together and by the s dark matter began to be accepted in it was inferred that the universe s expansion not slowing is accelerating indicating a vast energy density enough to accelerate both visible matter and dark matter throughout the universe a vast field of dark energy apparently under of the universe s composition is known while the other is mysterious dark matter and dark energy quantum realm strange mechanics by the s to probe the operating of the electromagnetic field at miniscule scales of space and time quantum mechanics qm was developed yet electrons the matter particles that interact with the photons that are the electromagnetic field s force carriers would appear to defy mechanical principles altogether none could predict a quantum particle s location from moment to moment in the slit experiment an electron would travel through one hole placed in front of it yet a single electron would travel simultaneously though multiple holes however many were placed in front of it the single electron would leave on the detection board an interference pattern as if the single particle were a wave that had passed through all the holes simultaneously and yet this occurred only when unobserved if light were shone on the expected event the photon s interaction with the field would set the electron to a single position by the uncertainty principle any quantum particle s exact location and momentum cannot be determined with certainty however the particle s interaction with the observation measurement instrument deflects the particle such that greater determination of its position yields lower determination of its momentum and vice versa field theory quantized by extending quantum mechanics across a field a consistent pattern emerged from location to adjacent location the probability of the particle existing there would rise and fall like a wave of probability a rising and falling probability density when unobserved any quantum particle enters superposition such that even a single particle fills the entire field however large yet the particle is not definitely anywhere in the field but there at a definite probability in relation to whether it was had been at the adjacent location the waveform of maxwell s electromagnetic field was generated by an accumulation of probabilistic events not the particles but the mathematical form was constant setting the field to special relativity permitted prediction of the complete electromagnetic field thus arose relativistic quantum field theory qft of the electromagnetic field it is relativistic quantum electrodynamics qed of the weak and electromagnetic fields together it is relativistic electroweak theory ewt of the strong field it is relativistic quantum chromodynamics qcd altogether this became the standard model of particle physics division in physics when the standard model is set to general relativity in order to include mass probability densities of infinity appear this is presumed incorrect as probability ordinarily ranges from to to probability some theoretical physicists suspect that the problem is in the standard model which represents each particle by a zero dimensional point that in principle can be infinitely small yet in quantum physics the planck s constant is the minimum energy unit that a field can be divided into perhaps a clue to the smallest size a particle can be so there is a quest to quantize gravity to develop a theory of quantum gravity concept framework string conjectures that on the microscopic scale einstein s d spacetime is a field of calabi yau manifolds each containing space dimensions curled up thus not extended into the space dimensions presented to the classical realm in string theory each quantum particle is replaced by a d string of vibrating energy whose length is the planck length as the string moves it traces width and thus becomes d a worldsheet as a string vibrates and moves within the d calabi yau space the string becomes a quantum particle with this approach the hypothetical graviton predicted to explain general relativity emerges easily theories string theory began as bosonic string theory whose dimensions act as many fewer yet this modeled only bosons which are energy particles while omitting fermions which are matter particles so bosonic string theory could not explain matter yet by adding supersymmetry to bosonic string theory fermions were achieved and string theory became super string theory explaining matter too in versions of quantum field theory that include supersymmetry susy each boson has a corresponding fermion and vice versa that is each energy particle has a corresponding matter particle and each matter particle has a corresponding energy particle yet the unobservable partner is more massive and thus super these superpartners might seem an extravagant prediction yet many theorists and experimentalists favor supersymmetric versions of the standard model whose equations must otherwise be tweaked extravagantly and sometimes arbitrarily to maintain predictive success or mathematical consistency but with the superpartners align controversies untestable unscientific string theory s claim that all molecules are strings of energy has drawn harsh criticism there are many versions of string theory none quite successfully predicting the observational data explained by the standard model m theory is now known to have countless solutions often predicting things strange and unknown to exist some allege that string theorists select only the desired predictions the allegation that string theory makes no testable predictions is false as it makes many no theory a predictive and perhaps explanatory model of some domain of natural phenomena is verifiable all conventional physical theories until the standard model have made claims about unobservable aspects of the natural world even the standard model has various interpretations as to the natural world when the standard model is operated it is often made a version with supersymmetry doubling the number of particle species so far identified by particle physicists none can literally measure space yet newton postulated absolute space and time and newton s theory made explicit predictions highly testable and predictively successful for years but the theory was still falsified as explanatory of nature physicists accept that there exists no such attractive force directly attracting matter to matter let alone that the force traverses the universe instantly nevertheless newton s theory is still paradigmatic of science hidden dimensions the idea of hidden dimensionality of space can seem occult some theorists of loop quantum gravity a contender for quantum gravity regard string theory as fundamentally misguided by presuming that space even has a shape until particles shape it that is they do not doubt that space takes various shapes simply regard the particles as determining space s shape not the other way around the spacetime vortex predicted by general relativity is apparently confirmed if interpreted as naturally true the standard model representing a quantum particle as a d point already indicates that spacetime is a sea of roiling shapes quantum foam string theorists tend to believe nature more elegant a belief that loop theorist lee smolin dismisses as romantic while using biology s modern synthesis as a rhetorical device experiments to detect added spatial dimensions have so far failed yet there is still the possibility that signs of them can emerge so many solutions m theory has many trillions of solutions leonard susskind a leader of string theory interprets string theory s plasticity of solutions as paradoxical support resolving the mystery of why this universe exists as m theory shows it but a variant of a general pattern that always approximately results general relativity has brought many discoveries that in were all but unimaginable except in fiction a solution of einstein s equations that sought to explain quantum particles dynamics the einstein rosen bridge predicts a shortcut connecting two distant points in spacetime commonly called a wormhole the einstein rosen bridge is doubted but not disproved showing either that not all consequences of a theory must be accurate or that reality is quite bizarre in ways unobservable many worlds even the standard model of particle physics suggests bizarre possibilities that populist accounts of science either omit or mention as unexplained curiosities the theory conventionally receives the copenhagen interpretation whereby the field is only possibilities none real until an observer or instrument interacts with the field whose wavefunction then collapses and leaves only its particle function only the particles being real yet wavefunction collapse was merely assumed neither experimentally confirmed nor even mathematically modeled and no variance from either the wavefunction in the quantum realm or the particle function in the classical realm has been found in hugh everett described his relative state interpretation everett maintained that the wavefunction does not collapse and since all matter and interactions are presumed to be built up from quantum waveparticles all possible variations of the quantum field indicated by the mathematical equations are real and simultaneously occurring but different courses of history by this interpretation whatever interacts with the field joins the field s state that is relative to the observer s state itself a waveform in its own quantum field while the two simply interact in a universal waveform never collapsing by now many physicists interpretation of the apparent transition from the quantum to the classical realms is not wavefunction collapse but quantum decoherence in decoherence an interaction with the field takes the observer into only one determinant constellation of the quantum field and so all observations align with that new combined quantum state everett s thesis has inspired many worlds interpretation whereby within our universe are predicted to be virtually or potentially infinite parallel worlds that are real yet each a minuscule distance from the other worlds as each world s waveform is universal not collapsing and its mathematical relations are invariant parallel worlds simply fill the gaps and do not touch many universes einstein doubted that black holes as predicted by the schwarzschild solution are real some now conjecture that black holes do not exist as such but are dark energy or that our universe is both a black hole and dark energy the schwarzschild solution of einstein s equations can be maximally extended to predict a black hole having a flip side another universe emerging from a white hole perhaps our universe s big bang was half of a big bounce something s collapse down to a black hole and our universe popping out its other side as a white hole particles are strings physicists widely doubt that quantum particles are truly d points as represented in standard model which offers formalism mathematical devices whose strokes predict phenomena of interest upon input of data not interpretation of the mechanisms determining those phenomena yet string theorists do tend to optimistically conjecture that the strings are both real and explanatory not merely predictive devices it is far beyond the capacity of today s particle accelerators to propel any probing particles at energy levels high enough to overcome a quantum particle s own energy and determine whether it is a string yet this limitation also exists on testing other theories of quantum gravity developments suggest other strategies to observe the structure of quantum particles paradoxically even if testing confirmed that particles are strings of energy that still would not conclusively prove even that particles are strings since there could be other explanations perhaps an unexpected warpage of space although the particle was a d point of true solidity even when predictions succeed there are many possible explanations the problem of underdetermination and philosophers of science as well as some scientists do not accept even flawless predictive success as verification of the successful theory s explanations if these are posed as offering scientific realism true description of the natural world matter is energy talk of particle physicists testing theoretical physicists predicted particles by colliding particles in accelerators suggests that quantum particles are tiny newtonian particles that experimentalists crack open to reveal their structure instead when two particles each of a certain mass measured in terms of energy as electronvolts are collided they can combine into a particle of that combined mass energy and the generated particle is observed for correspondence with the prediction it is not controversial among physicists that all particles are energy loop theorists sometimes in rivalry with string theory claim that spacetime itself converts into the particles matter s being a special variant of energy was a consequence of einstein s special theory of relativity and thereupon einstein formalized the mass energy equivalence e mc when sufficiently energetic photons collide they can combine and generate matter matter creation all particles have antiparticles and atoms of matter have antiatoms of antimatter whose union annihilates the particles and matter while leaving energy developments an inspiring development is discovery of mirror symmetry whereby calabi yau spaces tend to come in pairs such that solutions previously difficult within the extreme vibrational mode of one string can be solved by through the mirror calabi yau space s geometry in its opposite range string theory is usually solved through conformal field theory a quantum field theory on d space it is confirmed that molecules can collapse to d and the electron long presumed an elementary particle apparently splits into three entities separately carrying the electron s three degrees of freedom when the molecules that contain the electrons are channeled through a d pathway notes a scientist is a person who studies or has expertise in science a scientist tries to understand how our world or other things work scientists make observations ask questions and do extensive research work in finding the answers to many questions others may not know about scientist has searched many things scientists may work in laboratories for governments companies schools and research institutes some scientists teach at universities and other places and train people to become scientists scientists often make experiments to find out more about reality and sometimes may repeat experiments or use control groups scientists who are doing applied science try to use scientific knowledge to improve the world types of scientists scientists can work in different areas of science here are some examples scientists that study physics are physicists scientists that study chemistry are chemists scientists that study biology are biologists scientists that study rocks are geologists scientists that study plants are

speech during the th century soap was transported in wooden boxes when a person had new or unusual ideas and wanted to talk to a crowd about them sometimes he or she would stand on an empty soapbox so that everyone could see and hear the talk well people sometimes use the word soapbox to mean a place to say new or unusual things references the word supernatural is used for things that some people believe are real but that are not part of nature because we cannot prove whether these things are real people often disagree about these things some say that we should talk about things without talking about the supernatural because we cannot prove that supernatural things are real other people say that although we cannot prove supernatural things in a scientific way they are real some examples of supernatural things are magic miracles souls spirits or ghosts monsters grim reaper angels devils asuras or demon kami ufos legendary creatures god or gods parapsychology related pages religion belief superstition ritual near death experience a spirit is considered to be the part of a being that is not the body other words with the same meanings are soul and ghost when a body is alive it has a spirit in it death is when the spirit separates from the body christians believe that spirits exist in heaven or hell see timothy spiritualists believe that spirits can talk with people or change things in the world many religions forbid communicating with such spirits in any way see leviticus but a few include this as part of their practice another use of spirit means the main purpose or meaning of a sentence or document for example the spirit of a law is the true meaning of the law which the creator wanted this phrase is often used when the words and sentences of a law could mean more than one thing but a judge must decide what meaning is correct flax seeds a seed is the part of a seed plant which can grow into a new plant it is a reproductive structure which disperses and can survive for some time a typical seed includes three basic parts an embryo a supply of nutrients for the embryo and a seed coat there are many different kinds of seeds some plants make a lot of seeds some make only a few seeds are often hard and very small but some are larger the coconut is as big as a child s head but it contains more than just a seed at the start seeds are dormant resting inside their coat for a while when the seed is ready to develop it needs water air and warmth but not sunlight to become a seedling seeds carry the food that helps the new plant begin to grow this food store is in the endosperm and or in the cotyledons many kinds of seeds are good food for animals and people the many kinds of grain that people grow such as rice wheat and maize are all seeds seeds are often inside fruits development from the seed a seed though not active is a tiny living thing it contains the embryo of the future plant which is not changing or developing it is dormant the common idea is that the seed sleeps until it gets what it needs to wake up that is not correct different seeds have different habits no doubt adapted to their habitat there are different kinds of resting stages in seeds seed dormancy means the seed does not develop for a while even when conditions are suitable p delayed germination development allows time for dispersal changes take place inside the seed which sooner or later make it germinate the details vary hugely between species seed hibernation fails to germinate because conditions are not right growth is triggered by particular events in the environment details of the triggers are known for some but not all seeds rain fire ground temperature are examples many seeds only germinate after they have been eaten and passed through the digestive system of an animal this also is a dispersal method when a seed germinates wakes up it begins to grow into a little plant called a seedling it uses the soft fleshy material inside the seed for nutrients food until it is ready to make food on its own using sunlight water and air most seeds germinate underground where there is no sunlight the plant does not need the nutrients in soil for a few days or weeks because the seed has all the things it needs to grow later though it will begin to need sunlight if there is sunlight the plant will use it to grow healthy if there is no light the plant will still grow for a while but its plastids will not mature the chlorophyll does not turn green if the plant does not get enough light it will eventually die it needs light to make food for itself when the reserve in the seed runs out the oldest carbon dated seed that has grown into a plant was a judean date palm seed about years old recovered from excavations at herod the great s palace on masada in israel it was germinated in the largest seed is produced by the coco de mer or double coconut palm lodoicea maldivica the entire fruit may weigh up to kilograms pounds and usually contains a single seed origin and evolution seeds have been an important development in the reproduction and spread of conifers and flowering plants plants such as mosses liverworts and ferns do not have seeds and use unprotected spores and other methods to propagate themselves before the upper devonian period land plants like modern ferns reproduced by sending spores into the air the spores would land and become new plants only in favourable conditions spores have little food stored and may be just single cells rather than embryos the evolution of seeds changed the plant life cycle by freeing plants from the need for external water for sexual reproduction and by providing protection and nutrients for the developing embryo these functions allowed plants to expand beyond the immediate neighbourhood of water sources they were able to exploit environments which were drier and more upland p this can be seen by the success of seed plants in important biological niches on land from forests to grasslands both in hot and cold climates the present day seed plants are the gymnosperms with naked seeds and the angiosperms with covered seeds usually fruits the first true seeds are from the upper devonian million years ago which is probably the theatre of their first evolutionary radiation the earliest seed producing trees were in the forests of the carboniferous period p the seed plants steadily became one of the most important elements of nearly all ecosystems references sailing boat a sail is a large piece of cloth on the top of some boats the wind goes around the sail and makes the boat move through the water the piece that the sail is attached to is called a mast some boats have many sails and some have only one usually small boats have only one sail and bigger boats have more boats with sails are called sailing boats there are many different names for different kinds of sailing boats with different kinds of sails before people made boats with engines that used coal or oil sailing boats were an important way to travel across oceans now they are not so important for transport but they are still used for recreation and competition sail types diagram of sailboat in this case a typical monohull sloop with a bermuda or marconi rig modern sails can be classified into three main categories a mainsail is a sail located behind the main mast of a sailing vessel a headsail also known as the jib sail is any sail set forward of the main mast a spinnaker or downwind sail also termed kite special purpose sails are often a variation of the three main categories a staysail is a fore and aft rigged sail whose luff can be attached to a forestay running from a mast to the bowsprit high performance yachts in particular some catamarans such as the international c class catamaran have used or use rigid wing sails which are said to perform better than traditional soft sails in particular a rigid wing sail was used by stars and stripes the defender which won the america s cup and by usa the challenger which won the america s cup most modern yachts including bermuda rig ketch and yawl boats have a sail inventory which usually includes more than one of these types of sails although the mainsail is permanently hoisted while sailing headsails and spinnakers can be changed depending on the particular weather conditions to allow better handling and speed references other websites the quest for the perfect sailshape the headsail youtube the mainsail youtube close view of the skin on a human hand skin is the outside covering of animals the skin of different kinds of animals is very different many kinds of animals have hair or fur on their skin birds have feathers on their skin most fish and reptiles like snakes and lizards have scales on their skin the skin of human beings usually has very small hairs on it that are hard to see some people have more hair or hair that is easier to see and some have less people have hair that is longer and easier to see on some parts of their bodies such as the tops of their heads and men s beards the skin is actually the largest organ of the human body without our skin we would easily get infected with diseases and viruses keeping it clean is important to health the skin of cows can be made into leather leather is sometimes used to make shoes bags and balls other things can be said to have skins people often say that fruits such as apples and bananas and vegetables such as potatoes have skins other websites a search engine is a website that allows users to look up information on the world wide web www the search engine will achieve this by looking at many web pages to find matches to the user s search input text it will return results ranked by relevancy and popularity by the search engine some popular search engines are google yahoo ask com forestle and bing older services include webcrawler lycos and alta vista to use a search engine you must enter at least one keyword in to the search box usually an on screen button must be clicked on to submit the search the search engine looks for matches between the keyword s entered and its database of websites and words after the user inputs their search or query into the search bar a list of results will appear on the screen know as search engine results page serp this list of webpages contains matches related to the user s query in a particular order determine by a ranking system most search engine will remove spam pages from the list of results to provide a better list of results the user can then click on any of the links to go to that webpage search engines are some of the most advanced websites on the web they use special computer code to sort the web pages on serps the most popular or highest quality web pages will be near the top of the list when a user types words into the search engine it looks for web pages with those words there could be thousands or even millions of web pages with those words so the search engine helps users by putting the web pages it thinks the user wants first search engines are very useful to find information about anything quickly and easily using more keywords or different keywords improves the results of searches a search service may also include a portal with news games and more information besides a search engine yahoo has a popular portal and msn search is part of the msn portal while google has a simple design on its front page search services usually work without charging money for finding sites and are often supported with text or banner advertisements sabbath in christianity is the day of rest and service to god the idea of the sabbath in christianity comes directly from the idea of the sabbath or shabbat in judaism in fact the word sabbath itself comes from the hebrew word shabbat like the jewish sabbath shabbat the sabbath in christianity comes from the genesis story of creation but unlike jews most christians have sabbath on sunday not saturday they also rest but not the same way as jews the exact way depends on the church denomination differing views most christians honor the sabbath on sunday to remember the resurrection of jesus on the first day of the week on the jewish calendar they say that there is an analogy between the obligation of the christian day of worship and the sabbath day ordinance these two rules are not literally identical though they say that this ordinance is no longer valid because god has replaced his old creation by a new one for this reason the obligation to keep the sabbath is not the same for christians as for jews they say there are examples in the new testament and in other writings surviving from the first few centuries some conservative christians are sabbatarians most of these follow the reformed traditions sabbatarians think the first day of the week or lord s day is the new sabbath this is because the th commandment has never been revoked and sabbath keeping is in any case a creation ordinance still others believe that the sabbath remains as a day of rest on the saturday reserving sunday as a day of worship in reference to acts the disciples came together on the first day of the week sunday to break bread and to hear the preaching of the apostle paul this is not the first time christians assembled together on a sunday jesus appeared to the christians on the first day of the week while they were in hiding one can maintain this argument in that jesus himself maintained the sabbath although not within the restrictions that were mandated by jewish traditions the pharisees often tried jesus by asking him if certain tasks were acceptable according to the law this would seem to show that while the sabbath was still of importance to the jews sunday was a separate day for worship and teaching from scriptures the seventh day adventists and other churches disagree with some of these views they argue that the custom of meeting for worship on sunday originated in paganism specifically sol invictus and mithraism in which sun god worship took place on sunday this is therefore an explicit rejection of the commandment to keep the seventh day holy instead they keep saturday as the sabbath as a memorial to god s work of creation believing that none of the ten commandments can ever be destroyed seventh day sabbatarians claim that the seventh day sabbath was kept by the majority of christian groups until the nd and rd century by most until the th and th century and a few thereafter but because of opposition to judaism after the jewish roman wars the original custom was gradually replaced by sunday as the day of worship the history of these changes is certainly not altogether lost regardless of any belief in a suppression of the facts by a conspiracy of the pagans of the roman empire and the clergy of the catholic church jews had come to be hated in the roman empire after the jewish roman wars this led to the criminalization of the jewish sabbath hatred of jews is apparent in the council of laodicea th century ad where canon states it is not lawful to receive portions sent from the feasts of jews or heretics nor to feast together with them and it is not lawful to receive unleavened bread from the jews nor to be partakers of their impiety in keeping with this rejection of the jews this roman council also criminalized the jewish sabbath as can be seen in canon of the council laodicea christians must not judaize by resting on the sabbath but must work on that day rather honoring the lord s day and if they can resting then as christians but if any shall be found to be judaizers let them be excommunicated from christ in the gospel of mark jesus says the son of man is lord even of the sabbath references statistics is a branch of mathematics dealing with data collection organization analysis interpretation and presentation descriptive statistics summarize data inferential statistics make predictions statistics helps in the study of many other fields such as science medicine economics psychology politics and marketing someone who works in statistics is called a statistician in addition to being the name of a field of study the word statistics also refers to numbers that are used to describe data or relationships history the first known statistics are census data the babylonians did a census around bc the egyptians around bc and the ancient chinese around bc starting in the th century mathematicians such as gerolamo cardano developed probability theory which made statistics a science since then people have collected and studied statistics on many things trees starfish stars rocks words almost anything that can be counted has been a subject of statistics collecting data before we can describe the world with statistics we must collect data the data that we collect in statistics are called measurements after we collect data we use one or more numbers to describe each observation or measurement for example suppose we want to find out how popular a certain tv show is we can pick a group of people called a sample out of the total population of viewers then we ask each viewer in the sample how often they watch the show the sample is data that you can see and the population is data that you cannot see since you did not ask every viewer in the population for another example if we want to know whether a certain drug can help lower blood pressure we could give the drug to people for some time and measure their blood pressure before and after descriptive and inferential statistics numbers that describe data that you can see are called descriptive statistics numbers that make predictions about data that you can t see are called inferential statistics descriptive statistics involves using numbers to describe features of data for example the average height of women in the united states is a descriptive statistic that describes a feature average height of a population women in the united states once the results have been summarized and described they can be used for prediction this is called inferential statistics as an example the size of an animal is dependent on many factors some of these factors are controlled by the environment but others are by inheritance a biologist might therefore make a model that says that there is a high probability that the offspring will be small in size if the parents were small in size this model probably allows to predict the size in better ways than by just guessing at random testing whether a certain drug can be used to cure a certain condition or disease is usually done by comparing the results of people who are given the drug against those of people who are given a placebo methods most often we collect statistical data by doing surveys or experiments for example an opinion poll is one kind of survey we pick a small number of people and ask them questions then we use their answers as the data the choice of which individuals to take for a survey or data collection is important as it directly influences the statistics when the statistics are done it can no longer be determined which individuals are taken suppose we want to measure the water quality of a big lake if we take samples next to the waste drain we will get different results than if the samples are taken in a far away hard to reach spot of the lake there are two kinds of problems which are commonly found when taking samples if there are many samples the samples will likely be very close to what they are in the real population if there are very few samples however they might be very different from what they are in the real population this error is called a chance error see errors and residuals in statistics the individuals for the samples need to be chosen carefully usually they will be chosen randomly if this is not the case the samples might be very different from what they really are in the total population this is true even if a great number of samples is taken this kind of error is called bias errors we can reduce chance errors by taking a larger sample and we can avoid some bias by choosing randomly however sometimes large random samples are hard to take and bias can happen if different people are not asked or refuse to answer our questions or if they know they are getting a fake treatment these problems can be hard to fix see also standard error descriptive statistics finding the middle of the data the middle of the data is called an average the average tells us about a typical individual in the population there are three kinds of average that are often used the mean the median and the mode the examples below use this sample data name a b c d e f g h i j score mean the formula for the mean is where are the data and is the population size see sigma notation this means that you add up all the values and then divide by the number of values in our example the problem with the mean is that it does not tell anything about how the values are distributed values that are very large or very small change the mean a lot in statistics these extreme values might be errors of measurement but sometimes the population really does contain these values for example if in a room there are people who make day and who makes day the mean of the data is day even though it is the average amount the mean in this case is not the amount any single person makes thus is useless for some purposes this is the arithmetic mean other kinds are useful for some purposes median the median is the middle item of the data to find the median we sort the data from the smallest number to the largest number and then choose the number in the middle if there is an even number of data there will not be a number right in the middle so we choose the two middle ones and calculate their mean in our example there are items of data the two middle ones are and so the median is another example like the income example presented for the mean consider a room with people who have incomes of and the median is because is the average of the two middle numbers and if the extreme value of is ignored the mean is in this case the median is close to the value obtained when the extreme value is thrown out the median solves the problem of extreme values as described in the definition of mean above mode the mode is the most frequent item of data for example the most common letter in english is the letter e we would say that e is the mode of the distribution of the letters for example if in a room there are people with incomes of and the mode is because occurs three times and all other values occur fewer than three times there can be more than one mode for example if in a room there are people with incomes of and the modes are and this is bi modal or has two modes bi modality is very common and often indicates that the data is the combination of two different groups for instance the average height of all adults in the u s has a bi modal distribution this is because males and females have separate average heights of m ft in for men and m ft in for women these peaks are apparent when both groups are combined the mode is the only form of average that can be used for data that can not be put in order finding the spread of the data another thing we can say about a set of data is how spread out it is a common way to describe the spread of a set of data is the standard deviation if the standard deviation of a set of data is small then most of the data is very close to the average if the standard deviation is large though then a lot of the data is very different from the average if the data follows the common pattern called the normal distribution then it is very useful to know the standard deviation if the data follows this pattern we would say the data is normally distributed about of every pieces of data will be off the average by less than the standard deviation not only that but about of every measurements will be off the average by less that two times the standard deviation and about in will be closer to the average than three standard deviations other descriptive statistics we also can use statistics to find out that some percent percentile number or fraction of people or things in a group do something or fit in a certain category for example social scientists used statistics to find out that of people in the world are males other websites speed has when distance that an object moves in a given amount of time speed is a measure of how fast something is moving the average speed of an object in a certain time is the distance the object travelled divided by the time speed is also the distance covered by an object per unit time finding speed to find speed where is the distance and is the time that has gone by units of measurement for speed there are many units of measurement for speed for example an object s speed can be measured in miles per hour mph kilometers per hour km h meters per second m s which is the si unit for speed changing speed when an object changes speed it gets faster or slower if the speed of the object increases it is called acceleration if the object gets slower and the speed decreases it is called deceleration or negative acceleration related pages velocity momentum quantum mechanics metric system other websites a stack of servers a server is also a person who serves like a waiter at a restaurant or in a hotel in net jargon a server is a computer that serves many kinds of information to user or client machines usually a server will only do a few things for many clients every type of thing a server does is called a service services are used by other computers that are called clients the relationship between client and server is called a client server relationship for example wikipedia has web servers which have a service for sending web pages over the internet your client computer talks to wikipedia s web page service to get web pages for you a server can also host internet games share files and give access to peripheral equipment such as printers in simple words the individual computers are connected to some powerful computers called servers these store files and information in the form of website with an internet connection different users anywhere in the world can access these files so that servers and clients can talk to each other they need to be connected to a network and they need to use the same protocol in networks a protocol is a set way for machines to talk to other machines it is just like a language for example the wikipedia server runs the http to send web sites to your computer and your computer uses the http protocol to ask wikipedia for pages usually servers are specially made to be more powerful and reliable and they are much more expensive than normal computers sometimes servers can be clustered which means that lots of servers work together to do one service the server might slow down if there are too many people accessing the server at the same time resulting in a high load it might also be unable to take the high load so it will automatically shut down in a peer to peer system every computer is both a client and a server to the others this is commonly put into file sharing and voip however this can help in attempts at piracy typical server operating systems are linux freebsd netbsd and openbsd unlike other computers a server often has no monitor keyboard or mouse when a server doesn t have to do very much server software can run on a computer that is also doing other things web server a web server is a type of server that is used to host websites examples of web server software include apache or iis a web server can host one or many websites the default port for a web server to listen to is port http or https some web servers do other things than just serving a web page for example they may have something called ssi that makes building a website easier web servers use services like cgi to let software on the server make web pages some of the programming languages that can use cgi are scripting languages like perl python php or asp some are compiled languages like c or java related pages file server a simile is a figure of speech that compares two different things usually by using the words like or as it is used to make a direct comparison similes may be confused with metaphors which do the same kind of thing similes use comparisons with the words like or as metaphors

relations is an old manuscript written by the arabic scholar sayf al din al amidi he talks about similes illustration of the book leviathan by thomas hobbes in modern politics a state is an association which has control over a geographic area or territory states are seen as having three main pieces a territory a people some institutions which have the power to make rules there are different forms of government a state can have for example a republic or a monarchy sometimes states form their own countries at other times many states work together to form a country like the united states most states also have armed forces civil service law and police history early states the earliest states were just human settlements a group of farmers and merchants working together could be states since people can control them and protect them more organized states could be monarchies such as early egypt under the pharaoh following this were larger more military based states such as the babylonian empire or roman empire the most famous early states however were the ancient greek states which had freedom writing and a democracy from military to modern state when the military based state the roman empire and fell lots of little states were made and each was also military based and controlled by a king these states did not often work together and war raged however once people within the state itself started fighting what s called a civil war the kings had to make peace and start parliaments modern states economy modern states soon started in the late th century the main states in europe were england under the tudors spain under the habsburg france under the bourbons russia under catherine the great and alexander the second these states all tried to improve their politics and economy and became more and more like the states today they formed proper boundaries for their lands and worked with power within the state itself more such as the church or the nobility they made armies tax systems and embassies all to help make them more powerful and stable different types of state types of state can be separated into two categories democracy and dictatorship however just because a group of states are all democratic does not mean that they follow the same rules iran pakistan france germany and the united states of america are all states each of them sees itself as a democracy each of them however has a different idea of what democracy really means different states of the same category can also function differently for example two democratic states may be quite different if one has a well trained police or army while the other does not therefore the word state only tells us what type of government that state follows democratic or dictatorship and does not tell us about the country itself sub categories of state there are lots of sub types of state branching off from democracy and dictatorship the main ones are pluralism marxism and institutionalism pluralism pluralism has been very popular in the united states it shows the state as a neutral place for settling arguments between other states pluralism tells us that all people are not equal but still allows each group of people to tell the state what to do this type of state is called a polyarchy also in a pluralist state politics the military and the economy are all united and work together this means that all power in the state is diffused across the people who live there marxism marxism was popular in europe in the s and s it was started by karl marx and friedrich engels marxism rejects the idea that a state is there for all the people living in it and is definitely not a neutral place for settling arguments the main job of a marxist state is to protect capitalist made profits and to help people make contracts to keep economy in the state fair this is a good idea however the person who makes the money by using production or contracts has power over the people who do not make as much money as him this means that the working class the people who work in factories etc have hardly any power but the people who own the factories have a lot of power basically instead of giving power to everyone such as a polyarchy would do only a small part of the people have power institutionalism both marxism and pluralism states have to react to the activities of groups of people in the state itself institutionalist states do not see themselves as instruments to be controlled they are more just geographical areas in this area the people just form groups themselves an institutionalist state can be made up of both marxist and pluralist people both which have the power to control themselves and not influence the other parties of the state anarchism anarchism is when a group of people have complete freedom and do not believe in having a state at all anarchists are a lot like marxists since they do not believe that all people are equal but they believe opposite to marxists that a country can work without any organizations in it law and order are not necessary anarchists such as bakunin and kropotkin in the th century often want a form of marxism but ignoring some of their rules they want workers to manage themselves and simply get paid for what they do rather than getting paid in wages related pages country sovereign state international relations list of

sprout creek a stream is a natural flow of water moving across country between banks it is smaller than a river the primary meaning of stream is a body of water confined within a bed and banks and having a detectable current synonyms or related words include river creek tributary run branch brook bourne wash and fork navigable streams are sometimes called waterways though the term may apply to any size of permanent and natural water feature except oceans in the united states an intermittent stream is one that only flows for part of the year and is marked on topographic maps with a line of blue dashes and dots in desert areas of the american southwest this also includes washes which only flow after thunderstorms or other significant rains a blue line stream is one which flows for most or all of the year and is marked on topographic maps with a solid blue line in australia an intermittent stream is usually called a creek and marked on topographic maps with a solid blue line generally streams that form only during and immediately after precipitation are termed ephemeral streams streams in geographic terms are awarded order designations a stream of the first order is a blue line stream which does not have any other blue line stream feeding into it a stream of the second order is one which is formed by the joining of two or more blue line streams a third order stream is one below the confluence of two or more second order streams a fourth order stream is formed by the confluence of at least two third order streams and so forth typically streams are said to have a particular profile beginning with steep gradients no flood plain and little shifting of channels eventually evolving into streams with low gradients wide flood plains and extensive meanders the initial stage is sometimes termed a young stream and the later state a mature or old stream however a stream may meander for some distance before falling into a young stream condition the gradient of a stream is a critical factor in determining its character and is entirely determined by its base level of erosion the base level of erosion is the point at which the stream either enters the ocean a lake or pond or enters a stretch in which it has a much lower gradient and may be specifically applied to any particular stretch of a stream in geologic terms the stream will erode down through its bed to achieve the base level of erosion throughout its course if this base level is low then the stream will rapidly cut through underlying strata and have a steep gradient and if the base level is relatively high then the stream will form a flood plain and meanders when a stream flows over an especially resistant stratum and forms a waterfall or cascade or the same results because for some reason the base level of erosion suddenly drops perhaps as a result of a fault the resulting sudden change in stream elevation is called a nickpoint the stream of course expends kinetic energy in trying to eliminate the nickpoint meanders are looping changes of direction of a stream these may be somewhat sine wave in form typically over time the meanders don t disappear but gradually migrate downstream however if some resistant material slows or stops the downstream movement of a meander a stream may erode through the neck between two legs of a meander to become temporarily straighter leaving behind an arc shaped body of water termed an oxbow lake or bayou a flood may also result in a meander being cut through in this way the point of origin of a stream is often called the headwaters or source the entire basin drained by the stream is termed the watershed every watershed is made up of smaller watersheds while most watersheds are parts of larger watersheds for instance the continental divide in north america divides the atlantic ocean watershed from the pacific ocean watershed but the atlantic ocean watershed may be first divided into the atlantic ocean drainage and the gulf of mexico drainage this delineation within the united states is termed the eastern divide the gulf of mexico watershed may be divided into mississippi river basin and a number of smaller watersheds such as the tombigbee river watershed the mississippi river watershed includes the ohio river watershed which in turn includes the kentucky river watershed and so forth the point at which a stream empties into an ocean or other large body of relatively level water is termed the mouth there may often be an estuary or delta at the mouth some streams flow underground through unconsolidated sediments or through caves especially with caves a stream may flow aboveground for part of its course and underground for part of its course when a stream emerges from an underground course it is termed a spring the study of streams and waterways in general is known as surface hydrology and is important in environmental geography or environmental geology related pages waterfall river waterway

solar system is the sun and all the objects that orbit around it the sun is orbited by planets asteroids comets and other things the solar system is about billion years old it formed by gravity in a large molecular cloud most of this matter gathered in the center and the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the solar system it is thought that almost all stars form by this process the sun is a star it contains of the solar system s mass this means that it has strong gravity the other objects are pulled into orbit around the sun the sun is mostly made out of hydrogen and some helium there are eight planets in the solar system from closest to farthest from the sun they are mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune the first four planets are called terrestrial planets they are mostly made of rock and metal and they are mostly solid the last four planets are called gas giants this is because they are much larger than other planets and are mostly made of gas the solar system also contains other things there are asteroids mostly between mars and jupiter further out than neptune there is the kuiper belt and the scattered disc these areas have dwarf planets including pluto there are thousands of very small objects in these areas there are also comets centaurs and there is interplanetary dust six of the planets and three of the dwarf planets are orbited by moons furthermore planetary dust orbits the gas giants many other systems like the solar system have been found each of the billions of stars in the milky way galaxy might have a planetary system evolution of the solar system the formation and evolution of the solar system began billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud most of the collapsing mass collected in the centre forming the sun while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk of loose dust out of which the planets moons asteroids and other solar system bodies formed this model known as the nebular hypothesis was developed in the th s century by emanuel swedenborg immanuel kant and pierre simon laplace it has been adjusted by scientific disciplines such as astronomy physics geology and planetary science as our knowledge of space has grown the models have been changed to account for the new observations the solar system has evolved considerably since its initial formation many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets while other moons are believed to have formed and were later captured by their planets still others as the earth s moon may be the result of giant collisions many collisions between bodies have occurred and have been important to the evolution of the solar system in the early stages the positions of the planets sometimes shifted and planets have switched places this planetary migration is thought to have been responsible for much of the solar system s early evolution earth s orbit the earth s orbit around the sun is nearly a perfect circle but when mapped it is found that the earth moves around the sun in a very slightly oval shaped called an elliptical orbit the other planets in the solar system also circle the sun in slightly elliptical orbits mercury has a more elliptical orbit than the others and some of the smaller objects orbit the sun in very eccentric orbits discovery and exploration for thousands of years people had no need for a name for the solar system they thought the earth stayed still at the center of everything geocentrism although the greek philosopher aristarchus of samos suggested that there was a special order in the sky nicolaus copernicus was the first to develop a mathematical system that described what we now call the solar system this was called a new system of the world in the th century galileo galilei johannes kepler and isaac newton began helping people understand physics more clearly people began to accept the idea that the earth is a planet and moves around the sun and that the planets are worlds with the same physical laws that control earth more recently telescopes and space probes have led to discoveries of mountains and craters and seasonal meteorological phenomena such as clouds dust storms and ice caps on the other planets planetary distances not to scale the eight planets in their order from the sun mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus neptune the planets are the biggest objects that go around sun it took people many years of using telescopes to find the objects that were farthest away new planets might still be found and more small objects are found every year most of the planets have moons that orbit around them just as the planets orbit the sun there are at least of these moons in the solar system dwarf planets pluto had been called a planet since it was discovered in but in astronomers meeting at the international astronomical union decided on the definition of a planet and pluto did not fit instead they defined a new category of dwarf planet into which pluto did fit along with some others these small planets are sometimes called plutinos pluto ceres haumea eris makemake structure there are a few main parts of the solar system here they are in order from the sun with the planets numbered and the dwarf planets marked with the letters a e mercury venus earth and mars inner solar system the first four planets closest to the sun are called the inner planets they are small and dense terrestrial planets with solid surfaces they are made up of mostly rock and metal with a distinct internal structure and a similar size three also have an atmosphere the study of the four planets gives information about geology outside the earth most asteroids are also often counted with the inner planets terrestrial planets region contains the four planets closest to the sun all are rocky planets mercury venus earth mars asteroid belt region contains a ceres the only dwarf planet in this region asteroids outer solar system gas giant planets region contains jupiter saturn uranus neptune trans neptune region kuiper belt region contains b pluto c haumea d makemake kuiper belt objects and possibly other dwarf planets short period comets scattered disc region contains e eris scattered disk objects and possibly other dwarf planets oort cloud the oort cloud is separate from the trans neptune region and much farther out it contains the long period comets ecliptic plane the plane of the ecliptic is defined by the earth s orbit around the sun all of the planets orbit the sun roughly around this same orbital plane the farther away from this plane a planet orbits the more inclined is its orbit to the ecliptic if you could look at the solar system edge on then all the planets would be orbiting more or less in the plane of the ecliptic references more reading other websites views of the solar system your weight on other worlds solar system citizendium saturn is the sixth planet from the sun in the solar system it is the second largest planet in the solar system after jupiter saturn is one of the four gas giant planets along with jupiter uranus and neptune inside saturn is probably a core of iron nickel silicon and oxygen compounds surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen then a layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium and finally an outer gaseous layer saturn has known moons orbiting the planet are officially named which means that are waiting to be officially named the largest moon is titan which is larger in volume than the planet mercury titan is the second largest moon in the solar system the largest moon is jupiter s moon ganymede there is also a very large system of rings around saturn these rings are made of ice with smaller amounts of rocks and dust some people believe that the rings were caused from a moon impact or other event saturn is about km mi from the sun saturn takes earth years to revolve around the sun saturn was named after the roman god saturnus called kronos in greek mythology saturn s symbol is which is the symbol of saturnus sickle physical features saturn compared with the size of the earth drawing of saturn by robert hooke in saturn is an oblate spheroid meaning that it is flattened at the poles and it swells out around its equator the planet s equatorial diameter is while its polar diameter the distance from the north pole to the south pole is a difference saturn has a flattened shape due to its very fast rotation once every hours saturn is the only planet in the solar system that is less dense than water even though the planet s core is very dense it has a gaseous atmosphere so the average specific density of the planet is g cm this means if saturn could be placed in a large pool of water it would float atmosphere the outer part of saturn s atmosphere is made up of about hydrogen helium methane and ammonia there are also very small amounts of acetylene ethane and phosphine the north polar hexagonal cloud first found by voyager and later by cassini saturn s clouds show a banded pattern like the cloud bands seen on jupiter saturn s clouds are much fainter and the bands are wider at the equator saturn s lowest cloud layer is made up of water ice and is about thick the temperature here is quite low at k f c however scientists do not agree about this the layer above about thick is made up of ammonium hydrosulfide ice and above that is a layer of ammonia ice clouds thick the highest layer is made up of hydrogen and helium gases which extends between and above the water cloud tops auroras are also known to form in saturn in the mesosphere the temperature at saturn s cloud tops is extremely low at k f c the temperatures in the inner layers are much higher than the outside layers because of the heat produced by saturn s interior saturn s winds are some of the fastest in the solar system reaching km h mph ten times faster than winds on earth storms and spots saturn s atmosphere is also known to form oval shaped clouds similar to the clearer spots seen in jupiter these oval spots are cyclonic storms the same as cyclones seen on earth in the hubble space telescope found a very large white cloud near saturn s equator storms like the one in were known as great white spots these unique storms only exist for a short time and only happen about every earth years at the time of the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere great white spots were also found in and if this cycle continues another storm will form in about the voyager spacecraft found a hexagonal cloud pattern near saturn s north pole at about n the cassini huygens probe later confirmed it in unlike the north pole the south pole does not show any hexagonal cloud feature the probe also discovered a hurricane like storm locked to the south pole that clearly showed an eyewall until this discovery eyewalls had only been seen on earth interior saturn s interior is similar to jupiter s interior it has a small rocky core about the size of the earth at its center it is very hot its temperature reaches k saturn is so hot that it gives out more heat energy into space than it receives from the sun above it is a thicker layer of metallic hydrogen about deep above that layer is a region of liquid hydrogen and helium the core is heavy with about to times more mass than the earth s core magnetic field saturn has a natural magnetic field that is weaker than jupiter s like the earth s saturn s field is a magnetic dipole saturn s field is unique in that it is perfectly symmetrical unlike any other known planet this means the field is exactly in line with the planet s axis saturn generates radio waves but they are too weak to be detected from earth the moon titan orbits in the outer part of saturn s magnetic field and gives out plasma to the field from the ionised particles in titan s atmosphere rotation and orbit saturn s average distance from the sun is over km mi about nine times the distance from the earth to the sun it takes days or about years for saturn to orbit around the sun this is known as saturn s orbital period voyager measured saturn s rotation as being hours minutes at the equator hours minutes closer to the poles and hours minutes seconds for the planet s interior this is known as its rotational period cassini measured the rotation of saturn as being hours minutes seconds seconds that is about six minutes or one percent longer than the radio rotational period measured by the voyager and voyager spacecraft which flew by saturn in and saturn s rotational period is calculated by the rotation speed of radio waves released by the planet the cassini huygens spacecraft discovered that the radio waves slowed down suggesting that the rotational period increased since the scientists do not think saturn s rotation is actually slowing down the explanation may lie in the magnetic field that causes the radio waves planetary rings saturn is best known for its planetary rings which are easy to see with a telescope there are seven named rings a b c d e f and g rings they were named in the order they were discovered which is different to their order from the planet from the planet the rings are d c b a f g and e scientists believe that the rings are material left after a moon broke apart a new idea says that it was a very large moon most of which crashed into the planet this left a large amount of ice to form the rings and also some of the moons like enceladus which are thought to be made of ice history the rings were first discovered by galileo galilei in using his telescope they did not look like rings to galileo so he called them handles he thought that saturn was three separate planets that almost touched one another in when the rings were facing edge on with the earth the rings disappeared then reappeared again in further confusing galileo in christiaan huygens was the first person to recognise saturn was surrounded by rings using a much more powerful telescope than galilei s he noted saturn is surrounded by a thin flat ring nowhere touching in giovanni domenico cassini discovered that the planet s rings were in fact made of smaller ringlets with gaps the largest ring gap was later named the cassini division in james clerk maxwell showed that the rings cannot be solid but are made of small particles each orbiting saturn on their own otherwise it would become unstable or break apart james keeler studied the rings using a spectroscope in which proved maxwell s theory physical features the rings range from to above the planet s equator as proved by maxwell even though the rings appear to be solid and unbroken when viewed from above the rings are made of small particles of rock and ice they are only about thick made of silica rock iron oxide and ice particles the smallest particles are only specks of dust while the largest are the size of a house the c and d rings also seem to have a wave in them like waves in water these large waves are high but only moving slowly at about each day some scientists believe that the wave is caused by saturn s moons another idea is the waves were made by a comet hitting saturn in or the largest gaps in the rings are the cassini division and the encke division both visible from the earth the cassini division is the largest measuring wide however when the voyager spacecrafts visited saturn in they discovered that the rings are a complex structure made out of thousands of thin gaps and ringlets scientists believe this is caused by the gravitational force of some of saturn s moons the tiny moon pan orbits inside saturn s rings creating a gap within the rings other ringlets keep their structure due to the gravitational force of shepherd satellites such as prometheus and pandora other gaps form due to the gravitational force of a large moon farther away the moon mimas is responsible for clearing away the cassini gap recent data from the cassini spacecraft has shown that the rings have their own atmosphere free from the planet s atmosphere the rings atmosphere is made of oxygen gas and it is produced when the sun s ultraviolet light breaks up the water ice in the rings chemical reaction also occurs between the ultraviolet light and the water molecules creating hydrogen gas the oxygen and hydrogen atmospheres around the rings are very widely spaced as well as oxygen and hydrogen gas the rings have a thin atmosphere made of hydroxide this anion was discovered by the hubble space telescope spokes the spokes in saturn s rings photographed by voyager the voyager space probe discovered features shaped like rays called spokes these were also seen later by the hubble telescope the cassini probe photographed the spokes in they are seen as dark when under sunlight and appear light when against the unlit side at first it was thought the spokes were made of microscopic dust particles but new evidence shows that they are made of ice they rotate at the same time with the planet s magnetosphere therefore it is believed that they have a connection with electromagnetism however what causes the spokes to form is still unknown they appear to be seasonal disappearing during solstice and appearing again during equinox moons saturn has named moons and another nine which are still being studied many of the moons are very small are less than in diameter and moons are less than seven moons are large enough to be a near perfect sphere caused by their own gravitation these moons are titan rhea iapetus dione tethys enceladus and mimas titan is the largest moon larger than the planet mercury and it is the only moon in the solar system to have a thick dense atmosphere hyperion and phoebe are the next largest moons larger than in diameter in december and january a man made satellite called the cassini huygens probe took lots of close photos of titan one part of this satellite known as the huygens probe then landed on titan named after the dutch astronomer christiaan huygens it was the first spacecraft to land in the outer solar system the probe was designed to float in case it landed in liquid enceladus the sixth largest moon is about in diameter it is one of the few outer solar system objects that shows volcanic activity in scientists discovered an electric link between saturn and enceladus this is caused by ionised particles from volcanos on the small moon interacting with saturn s magnetic fields similar interactions cause the northern lights on earth exploration saturn as seen from the cassini spacecraft in saturn was first explored by the pioneer spacecraft in september it flew as close as above the planet s cloud tops it took photographs of the planet and a few of its moons but were low in resolution it discovered a new thin ring called the f ring it also discovered that the dark ring gaps appear bright when viewed towards the sun which shows the gaps are not empty of material the spacecraft measured the temperature of the moon titan in november voyager visited saturn and took higher resolution photographs of the planet rings and moons these photos were able to show the surface features of the moons voyager went close to titan and gained much information about its atmosphere in august voyager continued to study the planet photos taken by the space probe showed that changes were happening to the rings and atmosphere the voyager spacecrafts discovered a number of moons orbiting close to saturn s rings as well as discovering new ring gaps drawing of cassini in orbit around saturn on july the cassini huygens probe entered into orbit around saturn before then it flew close to phoebe taking very high resolution photos of its surface and collecting data on december the huygens probe separated from the cassini probe before moving down towards titan s surface and landed there on january it landed on a dry surface but it found that large bodies of liquid exist on the moon the cassini probe continued to collect data from titan and a number of the icy moons it found evidence that the moon enceladus had water erupting from its geysers cassini also proved in july that titan had hydrocarbon lakes located near its north pole in march it discovered a large hydrocarbon lake the size of the caspian sea near its north pole cassini observed lightning occurring in saturn since early the power of the lightning was measured to be times more powerful than lightning on earth astronomers believe that the lightning observed in saturn is the strongest ever seen notes refers to the level of one bar

person called a slave is treated as the property of another person called a master it often means that slaves are forced to work or else they will be punished by the law if slavery is legal in that place or by their master chains such as these were used to stop slaves from escaping there is evidence that even before there was writing there was slavery there have been different types of slavery and they have been in almost all cultures and continents some societies had laws about slavery or they had an economy that was built on it ancient greece and ancient rome had many slaves during the th century almost all countries made laws forbidding slavery the universal declaration of human rights says that slavery is wrong slavery is now banned by international law nevertheless there are still different forms of slavery in some countries the english word slave comes from the medieval word for the slavic peoples of central europe and eastern europe because these were the last ethnic group to be captured and enslaved in central europe according to adam smith and auguste comte a slave was mainly defined as a captive or prisoner of war slave holders used to buy slaves at slave auctions in many cases slaves are not allowed rights early civilizations in one form or another slavery has been practiced since the earliest civilizations early hunter gatherers had no use for slaves they did everything for themselves having another pair of hands to help them meant another mouth to feed slavery or owning another person made no sense to these people once men gathered in cities and towns and there was more than enough food having a cheap supply of labor made sense this is when the earliest forms of slavery appeared slavery can be traced back to the earliest records such as the code of hammurabi c bc this refers to it as an established institution in the ancient near east captives obtained through warfare often became slaves this was seen by the laws in the bible book of deuteronomy as a legal form of slavery but the israelites were not allowed to enslave other israelites the deuteronomic code calls for the death penalty for the crime of kidnapping israelites to enslave them in ancient egypt slaves were mainly prisoners of war other ways people could become slaves was by inheriting the status from their parents who were slaves someone could become a slave if he could not pay his debts people also sold themselves into slavery because they were poor peasants and needed food and shelter the lives of slaves were normally better than that of peasants young slaves could not be put to hard work and had to be brought up by the mistress of the household not all slaves went to houses some also sold themselves to temples or were assigned to temples by the king slave trading was not very popular until later in ancient egypt afterwards slave trades sprang up all over egypt in many places citizens were partly or fully protected from being enslaved so most slaves were foreigners slavery in ancient rome adamo ghisi allegory of slavery etching roman slaves played an important role in society and the economy besides manual labor slaves performed many domestic services they could work at highly skilled jobs and professions teachers accountants and physicians were often slaves greek slaves were often highly educated unskilled slaves or those sentenced to slavery as punishment worked on farms in mines and at mills their living conditions were brutal and their lives short slaves were considered property under roman law and had no legal personhood unlike roman citizens they could be subjected to corporal punishment sexual exploitation prostitutes were often slaves torture and summary execution the testimony of a slave could not be accepted in a court of law unless the slave was tortured a practice based on the belief that slaves in a position to be privy to their masters affairs would be too virtuously loyal to reveal damaging evidence unless coerced over time however slaves gained increased legal protection including the right to file complaints against their masters attitudes changed in part because of the influence among the educated elite of the stoics whose egalitarian views of humanity extended to slaves roman slaves could hold property which even though it belonged to their masters they were allowed to use as if it were their own skilled or educated slaves were allowed to earn their own money with enough money they could buy their freedom after the roman empire broke up slavery gradually changed into serfdom the arab slave trade historians estimate that between ad and the s to million people were enslaved by arab slave traders they were taken from europe asia and africa across the red sea indian ocean and sahara desert male slaves were often employed as servants soldiers or workers by their owners most male slaves were castrated it is estimated that as many as out of every boys bled to death during the process but the high price of eunuchs made it worthwhile woman and children taken as slaves were mainly used as servants and concubines while the later atlantic slave trade concentrated on men for labor the arab slave trade started with men and boys but shifted over time to concentrate more on woman and young girls for sexual purposes the atlantic slave trade for four centuries beginning in the late th century millions of africans were taken as slaves by europeans the europeans were not the first to exploit africa for manpower beginning in about ad arab slave traders began taking slaves from africa they dealt mainly in castrated male slaves eunuchs according to ronald segal author of islam s black slaves the other black diaspora the calipha in baghdad at the beginning of the th century had black eunuchs and white eunuchs in his palace by the s arab slave traders had taken between and million slaves out of africa it is not certain that european slave traders obtained black slaves from the arab slave traders the arabs concentrated mainly on supplying their own needs europeans began exporting africans to the new world as a source of cheap labor on colonial plantations between and pope nicolas v issued a series of papal bulls authorizing the portuguese to take african slaves at first slave traders raided coastal areas and carried black people off but the mines and fields of the colonies needed more and more slaves in the early th century spain began to issue licenses and contracts to supply slaves by the s large slaving companies were established most of europe at the time was involved in the slave trade slavery in the americas many europeans who arrived in north america during the th and th centuries came under contract as indentured servants the change from indentured servitude to slavery was a gradual process in virginia the earliest legal documentation of such a shift was in this is where a negro john punch was sentenced to lifetime slavery for attempting to run away this case also marked the disparate treatment of africans as held by the virginia county court where two white runaways received far lesser sentences after planters started to ignore the expiration of indentured contracts they kept their servants as slaves for life this was demonstrated by the case johnson v parker the court ruled that john casor an indentured servant be returned to johnson who claimed that casor belonged to him for his life according to the u s census individuals representing of all us families owned slaves one third of southern families owned slaves slavery in united states was legally abolished by thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution in slavery today millions of people are still slaves in some parts of the world mostly in south asia and africa it is less common in the developed world because of better law enforcement but it still happens there as well the ways in which it is done have changed today slaves may work because of things like a high debt for example slaves have to work to pay off a debt many victims are told that their families will be harmed if they report the slave owners many slaves are forced to be domestic servants in some cases their families sell them to the slave owners some slaves have been trafficked from one part of the world to another these people are illegally in their host country and therefore do not report the abuse forced prostitution is a type of slavery another form of slavery still happening today is forced child labor some children have to work in mines or in plantations or they have to fight wars as child soldiers for no pay one study says that there are million people but others say there could be as many as million in slavery today other terms that describe the recruitement of laborers and that may have similarities to slavery are blackbirding impressment and shanghaiing countries slave contract lima peru some of the countries where there is still slavery are in africa the middle east and south asia in summer people were found to be slaves for brick makers in china they included children the chinese government made a force of police check northern chinese brick kilns for slaves and sent lots of kiln supervisors and officials to prison and sentenced one kiln foreman to death for killing a worker who was a slave in mauritania it is thought that up to men women and children or of the population are slaves and that many of them are used as bonded labour slavery in mauritania was made illegal in august in niger there is also much slavery a

international labour organization said that it would prosecute members of the junta that rules myanmar also called burma at the international court of justice for crimes against humanity this is because the military makes some citizens do forced labour the international labour organisation says that it thinks that about people are forced to work this way scholars of islamic law have condemned the revival of the slave trade of non muslim women by the islamic state of iraq and the levant stopping slavery an agitation called abolitionism against slavery began in christian countries in the th century first they abolished the slave trade so more people wouldn t become slaves in the british empire stopped slavery several other countries followed in the united states disagreement over slavery led to the american civil war and the emancipation proclamation in when the north won all slaves were made free still more countries abolished slavery afterwards pedro ii of brazil abolished it in forced labor however continued either against the law or by debt peonage or other methods which the laws of the various countries did not count as slavery a slave who was beaten very badly the person

living human being which is supernatural and lives after death it cannot be discovered by science because it cannot be tested in any controlled way many different opinions exist as to what happens to personal experience after death most atheists say that there is no such thing as a soul and that the body is the only part of a person reincarnation is a belief that after the body dies the soul will be born again in another body popular culture in popular culture soul usually means deep feeling and commitment it is in this sense that the word appears in the term soul music however that music was also influenced by gospel music which was religious one popular idea about souls that is easy to express is that a person is a soul and has a body the soul is the i in i exist that feels and lives life what people call the mind could be part of the soul one soul started this article other souls have edited it and another soul is reading it this view however implies that the human body is a possession and seems to devalue bodies that do not have souls as defined or understood by the speaker some people say that animals heretics and people of another religion do not have souls like most uses of the verb to be there is an ideology in these simple words christianity teaches that all humans have an immortal soul this means that it is a part of them which does not die when their physical body dies but lives on with them to heaven or to hell christians believe that the soul is the breath of life which god gave to adam in japan the soul is believed to weigh grams this belief may have been influenced by the observations of dr mcdougall in the early s characteristics one distinction often made is between soul which is distinct from other souls and spirit which may be combined with that of other beings the idea of the holy spirit in christianity for example is a universal and shared spirit many souls are part of and which is expressed on earth in that faith by the church meaning the body of christ meaning all bodies that follow jesus this could be more inclusive than the is has view of souls and bodies related pages ancient egyptian concept of the soul references a bar of

can be broken down by bacteria however it is slightly soluble in water so it is not often used in washing machines it does not work well in hard water it cannot be used in strongly acidic solutions mild hand soaps are only basic enough to remove unwanted skin oils for other forms of oil dishwashing soap is strong enough to remove almost all forms of oil without damaging petroleum products such as plastics it does not damage skin either soap has been made in many ways humanity has used soap like things for thousands of years the earliest recorded evidence of the making of soap like materials dates back to around bc in ancient babylon a recipe for soap having water alkali and cassia oil was written on a babylonian clay tablet around bc the ebers papyrus egypt bc suggests that ancient egyptians bathed commonly and had animal and vegetable oils with alkaline salts to make a soap like substance egyptian documents say that a soap like substance was used in the preparation of wool for weaving references other links soap made from human corpses a summary is a condensed explanation of an event story document etc i e summing up the facts they are not constrained to any medium or topics not to be confused with abstract which is a summary of a document there are many different levels of summarization that can be done the summarizer may choose any length but the sumarees may not appreciate anything more than absolutely necessary to get the required facts summaries help to spread information fast they also help people make decisions on if it is something worth looking further into examples a quick good bad can suffice in some situations in other situations the summary may rival the length of the original this book was really cool this guy drives a pickup to work everyday and has a dangerous job many scientific journals publish a summary for every large article so people who do not have much time can read the main information quickly without spending too much time reading the article a service is a job or work done for someone else all the service trades in a place form a service economy the service economy can be in a region like a country or in a town or city structure often the person who gives the service will get something in return for the service the person who gives the service can get money in return the person who gives the service can get goods in return the person who gives the service can get another service in return this is a type of trade there are several meanings of the word sense this page is for disambiguation there are more detailed articles on each meaning when a word has several meanings one can refer to it as being used in the sense of some context or other in simple english for instance we avoid using words in unusual senses the sensory system of animals the human sensory system is usually said to have six senses hearing is the sense of sound that comes into our ears sight is the sense of seeing things with our eyes touch is the sense of feeling things with our skin taste is the sense of the flavor of things with our tongues smell is the sense of smelling things with our noses kinesthetic sense is knowing where your whole body is and where it is not other animals may have other senses fish have lateral lines which detect changes in the water pressure around them and some can detect changes in electric fields around them sense in language sense in this context is the meaning conveyed by language another use is to flag whether an argument or statement is correct and understood that makes no sense or that is nonsense are examples from everyday speech a variation of this is to say that something does not make economic sense usually these words signal a political dispute or some failure to define terms correctly the term common sense is thinking based on a wide experience of life it used to mean practical wisdom it has a long history of being used in politics often to mean that some idea will be accepted or rejected because of human nature what people are like the great synagogue in jerusalem a synagogue is a place where jews meet to worship and pray to god in hebrew a synagogue is called beit knesset which means a house of gathering the word synagogue comes from sunagoge which is a greek word in a synagogue jews carry out the jewish services which consist of prayers sometimes with special actions a synagogue will usually have a large room for prayers there might be some smaller rooms for studying there will be some offices there will also usually be a big room for special events the front of a synagogue faces towards jerusalem in israel in the front is the holiest part of the synagogue the ark this is a closet which has the torah scrolls inside the torah scrolls have the holy writings of judaism on them the ark usually has a curtain in front of it on top of the ark is light which is always lit called the eternal lamp it is a symbol which means that god is always there every synagogue has a raised platform called the bimah the person who reads the torah scroll stands there when he reads the bimah is either in the middle of the hall or in front of the ark in some synagogues men and women sit in different places some synagogues even have a short wall so that they can not see each other this is so that the people will think about the prayers better jews may call synagogues by different names many orthodox and conservative jews living in english speaking countries use the name synagogue or the word shul which is yiddish jews who speak spanish or portuguese call synagogues esnoga some jews call the synagogue a temple jewish worship does not have to be carried out in a synagogue it can be wherever a minyan of ten jews are it could be in someone s home or anywhere such as a cruise liner or an airplane some synagogues have a separate room or torah study this is called the beth midrash meaning house of study some kinds of jewish worship can be done alone or with fewer than ten people synagogues are places were jews can worship scarcity in economics is used to describe the lack of various forms of capital scarcity can be used to describe an economic situation in economics or it can be used to describe more general situations in economics scarcity is the result of people having unlimited wants and needs or always wanting something new and having limited resources limited resources means that there are never enough resources or materials to satisfy or fulfill the wants and needs that every person have scarcity is called the basic economic problem meaning that always exists scarcity exists due to the effects of nature such as drought floods storms pest infestation fire and other things real scarcity can also exist by over use of non renewable resources goods things and services are also scarce because there are only a limited number of things in the world and due to the limits of technology and our own priorities textual difficulty means how easy or hard a text is to read research has shown that two main factors affect the ease with which texts are read how difficult the words are this is lexical difficulty rare words are less well known than common words rare difficult words are often longer than common easy words how difficult the sentences are this is syntactical difficulty long complicated sentences cause more difficulty than short simple sentences readability predictions a readability test is a way to measure a text for how easy it is to read readability tests give a prediction as to how difficult readers will find a particular text they do this by measuring one or both of the two main causes as follows word difficulty word difficulty is usually measured by vocabulary lists or word length in bertha a lively and sidney l pressey published the first reading ease formula they had been concerned that science textbooks in junior high school had so many technical words they felt that teachers spent all class time explaining their meaning they argued that their formula would help to measure and reduce the vocabulary burden of textbooks their formula used the thorndike word list as a basis manually it took three hours to apply the formula to a book vocabulary lists several vocabulary lists have been published by researchers these lists are based on samples of published texts in english and less often samples of recorded spoken language the lists differ slightly according to the sources chosen but they are very reliable the items listed may represent more than one actual word they are lemmas for instance the entry be contains within it the occurrences of is was be and are the top lemmas account for of all the words in the oxford english corpus the reading teachers book of lists claims that the first words make up about one third of all printed material in english and that the first make up about one half of all written material one of the first readability tests the dale chall formula used a vocabulary list it counted the number of listed words in a passage and applied a formula which gave a grade level it was used to rate textbooks for grade levels in us school districts it is easy in principle to use a vocabulary list as part of a computer based readability measure the list is organised as a look up table the percentage of listed words in a passage gives the data for the formula and the user is presented with a grade level word length this is called an index or a proxy this is because word length is correlated with word frequency and word frequency is correlated with word difficulty longer words are on average harder than short words word length is measured by counting the letters in each word or by counting syllables since most syllables have one vowel some computer programs count vowels per average word a few tests measure the percentage of words on a list the list is based on the known frequency of words in a language sentence difficulty sentence difficulty is usually measured by sentence length this again is an index because longer sentences are on average harder than short sentences computers count the number of words between full stops but this is a second best method humans can judge whether a semi colon or colon should count as the end of a sentence for testing purposes since both factors may vary independently of each other the best prediction is gained by devising a formula with makes use of both indices what this means is that a single score is produced for a text and that score is looked up on a table or graph that tells you how difficult the text is in terms of either a an american school grade level or b an artificial scale of to either way is effective what really makes a difference is methods using both indices are more reliable than methods using only one index direct measurement it is possible to get a good prediction by getting a group of subjects to read through a passage followed by multiple choice questions even better is a method called cloze where subjects fill in blanks on a text they have not seen before the percentage of correctly completed blanks is an outstandingly good predictor of text difficulty naturally this kind of direct measure requires subjects and a skilled experimenter it also requires the prior preparation of texts suitable for the chosen sample of subjects the method is therefore too expensive for widespread use types of tests a person can perform readability tests himself by counting and doing some math or by using word processing software tests on subjects multiple

theatre british english and also american english or theater mostly american english has several meanings the word comes originally from the greek theatron meaning roughly a place to behold in american english the word theater can mean either a place where films are shown this is also called a cinema or a place where live stage plays are performed in british english theatre means a place where live plays are performed some people both english and american use the spelling theatre to mean a place where live plays are performed and the spelling theater to mean a cinema theatre can also mean the business of putting on plays an actor might say i am in the theatre business or a writer might say i write for the theatre meaning that they write plays rather than writing for movies or television shows history an ancient roman theatre in syria neolithic stone mask years bc ancient greece the first people we know created plays were the ancient greeks about the year b c they divided plays into two kinds tragedy and comedy this division is still used today the best known ancient greek writers of plays are aeschylus sophocles euripides and aristophanes some of their plays survived and are still performed today these ancient greek plays were performed outdoors in large amphitheatres so that many people could see them there were contests among the playwrights people who write plays are called playwrights and the winner would get a prize the greeks had many brilliant ideas they used mechanical devices like trap doors and the machina a crane for winching gods on and off the stage hence deus ex machina they had a greek chorus that offered information to help the audience follow the performance the chorus comments on themes and shows how an audience might react to the drama the players wore masks illustrations on vases show helmet like masks covering the entire face and head with holes for the eyes and a small aperture for the mouth plus a wig the mask was to melt into the face and allow the actor to vanish into the role therefore onlookers did not think about the actor but thought about the character middle ages in the middle ages the catholic church began to use theatre as a way of telling the stories from the bible to people who did not know how to read they wrote mystery plays where each part of the bible story would be a play put on by a different group of people they wrote miracle plays which were about the lives of the saints they wrote morality plays which taught the audiences how to live a good christian life commedia dell arte plays harlequine and columbine in the s groups of actors toured around italy performing comic plays to entertain townspeople these plays were called commedia dell arte and different stories would be created around the same group of characters often the spoken lines would be made up by the actors for each performance other kinds of plays called neoclassical dramas and neoclassical comedies were also popular in italy and in france at this time these plays were written to copy the style of the plays from ancient greece and rome elizabethan theatre at the end of the sixteenth century before the traveling actors began to perform in fixed theatre buildings this was the period when william shakespeare wrote he lived from to at that time in england women were not allowed to perform so male actors would play female characters his theatre was in london england it was called the globe theatre it was an outdoor theatre and plays were performed in the daytime for large audiences his plays were very popular and many are still performed today many people believe shakespeare was one of the best playwrights a writer of plays plays including shakespeare s were banned during the protectorate after that many more were written and acted plays from the s after world war ii playwrights in europe and the united states began doing plays in a new style called theatre of the absurd after seeing the horrors of war these playwrights felt that all their old values had been destroyed playwrights such as samuel beckett eugne ionesco harold pinter and jean genet wrote plays that are considered to be theatre of the absurd the theatre of the absurd plays have some of the same ideas that are found in the philosophy a way of thinking called existentialism existentialism is very different from many other philosophies most religions and philosopies say that human life has a meaning or a purpose the philosophy of existentialism is that human life does not have a meaning or a purpose when something has no meaning it is absurd absurd means means silly and meaningless the plays written in this style make people think about questions like what is it like to be a person in the world and what does it mean for a person to be free they are often filled with sad emotions such as worry fear and thoughts about death theatre breaks theatre breaks are a form of short holiday based around viewing a theatrical convention show theatre breaks tend to include a nights hotel accommodation included in the price references students working on a test a test is a way of checking something to see if it is true or false or if it is edible or not if something can be tested or finishes the tests correctly it is testable the concise oxford english dictionary defines a test as a procedure intended to establish the quality performance or reliability of something a test is different from an experiment before a test is done there is an expected result the test is performed to show this result in an experiment the outcome is open very often tests are performed as part of an experiment products products are usually tested for quality so customers will get good products in software engineering a test is used to see if the software system can do what it should software is tested before it is released alpha testing is where software developers check the software for bugs software can also be checked for quality and usability beta testing is done by groups of users tests of cars and other vehicles include a crash test the car is put under severe conditions to see what will make it fail or deliberately crashed to measure the damage other machines can also be crash tested crash test dummies can be used instead of humans they are placed in the car seat to see if a human in the crash would have been injured or killed people testing someone for diabetes people are tested to see what they have learned this is often called an assessment or examination in learning a test item is a question or set of questions many people think tests are valuable they believe tests are a quick and fair way of judging a test taker s performance enable predictions about test takers to be made allow selection improve performance by highlighting areas that need work however academic tests are not perfect measures tests could only partly measure a student s memory and maybe their understanding the test would only be about a small part of the subject and only at that moment in time measurement can vary considerably and randomly based on questions being asked people and animals can also be tested for illnesses for example a blood test can be used to check for disease science in science tests can done to check for a presence of a substance or to check the quality of something references other websites tests and experiments similarities and differences a time horizon is a future point in time when something must be done a deadline or will be over a time limit either way the matter will be closed when the time horizon is reached common time horizons people use are end of day usually meaning the working day the weekend end of month fiscal quarter end of school term end of calendar year and end of fiscal year it is very important to know at what time horizon something you are doing will be scored evaluated marked or paid for sports for example football soccer and basketball often have time limits baseball and others do not which sometimes causes problems a time limit is a time horizon that is imposed on everyone at once it may be used to try to achieve fairness in some system of ethics for instance if poor people and rich people are debating something a time limit may be imposed so that the rich people cannot keep debating until the poor people have to go to work and lose time limits are very important in accounting so that everyone can report their results for tax and investment purposes at the same time this in turn creates deadlines for the accountant and those reporting however the deadline is imposed by an authority whereas the time limit is imposed by a system so there can be slack in a deadline so that results do not have to be reported always very fast for example in the united states of america the end of the calendar year on december is the time limit for taxes but the deadline for reporting is april sometimes the government allows more time as it did for the families of those who were killed in the september attacks related pages time horizon deadline taiwan officially the republic of china roc chinese pinyin zhnghu mngu is a region in east

people s republic of china as china even though taiwan is not recognized by the un as a sovereign nation most countries still have close economic and cultural relations with taiwan so both sides are not making any big changes from the political status quo this policy was expressed in a consensus among some leaders of both sides in march china s government passed a law called the anti secession

of taiwan a trademark or trade mark is a way for a business to help people to identify the products that the business makes from products made by another business a trademark can be a name word phrase symbol logo design or picture it can only be used on things made by the business that owns the trademark for example coca cola and coke are trademark names for a certain drink made by the coca cola company no other business can use these names or any names similar to them other businesses can make a drink that is similar like colas soft drinks but they have to use a different name for their drink such as pepsi another example is the nike company which makes sporting goods like shoes and clothes the swoosh symbol used on their products is a trademark famous trademarks like coca cola and nike are used for branding whole families of products trademark and law getting a trademark trademarks are protected by law in some countries a person or company can get a trademark simply by using the name word phrase symbol logo design or picture on its products trademarks can also be registered in that case the business tells the government of its country that it wants to use a certain name word phrase symbol logo design or picture as a trademark for the products it sells if no other person or business is using the trademark to sell those products then the government will list that trademark once it is listed no one else can use that trademark for those products this is called registering the trademark using another person s trademark if someone uses the trademark in a wrong way the trademark owner can sue the other person if a court decides that the other person was not allowed to use the trademark they might have to pay damages to the trademark owner if another person wants to use a trademark that they do not own they can ask the trademark owner for permission the trademark owner can grant the other person a license the other person usually must pay some money to the trademark owner for the license this can be in the form of a percentage of the cost of the product that the other person sells called a royalty for example a person might pay nike ten percent of the cost of each pair of shoes it sells for the right to include the swoosh marking products with trademarks when people write a word that is a trademark or show a picture or symbol that is a trademark they should say that it is a trademark if a trademark is not registered they can write the word trademark use the abbreviation tm or use the symbol on their products if a trademark is registered they can use the letter r in a circle symbol people can also say it is a registered trademark or use the abbreviation reg service marks trademarks are used for products businesses that do things for people instead of making things are called service providers they can get a service mark instead of a trademark when people write or show a service mark they can use the service mark symbol laws by country

by rembrandt van rijn the ten commandments are a set of rules or laws god gave to the people of israel the commandments exist in different versions one version can be found in the book of exodus of the bible another version can be found in the book of horeb in the book of exodus the mountain is called mount sinai the book of horeb talks about mount horeb both are probably different names for the same mountain the rules were written on stone tablets these rules are important for judaism and christianity and for all societies based on their principles sometimes these rules are also called decalogue from greek can be translated as ten statements the name decalogue first occurs in the septuagint the israelites received the commandments after they had left egypt during the reign of pharaoh thutmose there are different texts talking about the commandments most of them are in the bible the book of exodus chapter and the book of deuteronomy chapter the qu ran mentions the tablets but does not list exactly the same commandments for instance quran starts with worshipping god alone and honouring your parents the ten commandments exodus esv the holy bible you shall have no other gods before me you shall not make for yourself a carved image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth you shall not bow down to them or serve them for i the lord your god and only worthy of worship visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments you shall not take the name of the lord your god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain remember the sabbath day to keep it holy six days you shall labor and do all your work but the seventh day is a sabbath to the lord your god on it you shall not do any work you or your son or your daughter or your servant or your livestock or the sojourner who is within your gates for in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that is in them and rested on the seventh day therefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and made it holy honor your father and your mother that your days may be long in the land that the lord your god is giving you you shall not murder you shall not commit adultery you shall not steal you shall not bear false witness against your neighbor you shall not covet your neighbor s house you shall not covet your neighbor s wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that is your neighbor s ten commandments in the old testament torah the ten commandments in deuteronomy chapter verses nkjv and moses called all israel and said to them hear o israel the statutes and judgments which i speak in your hearing today that you may learn them and be careful to observe them the lord our god made a covenant with us in horeb the lord did not make this covenant with our fathers but with us those who are here today all of us who are alive the lord talked with you face to face on the mountain from the midst of the fire i stood between the lord and you at that time to declare to you the word of the lord for you were afraid because of the fire and you did not go up the mountain he said i am the lord your god who brought you out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage you shall have no other gods before me you shall not make for yourself a carved image any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth you shall not bow down to them nor serve them for i the lord your god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate me but showing mercy to thousands to those who love me and keep my commandments you shall not take the name of the lord your god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain observe the sabbath day to keep it holy as the lord your god commanded you six days you shall labor and do all your work but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord your god in it you shall do no work you nor your son nor your daughter nor your male servant nor your female servant nor your ox nor your donkey nor any of your cattle nor your stranger who is within your gates that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you and remember that you were a slave in the land of egypt and the lord your god brought you out from there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm therefore the lord your god commanded you to keep the sabbath day honor your father and your mother as the lord your god has commanded you that your days may be long and that it may be well with you in the land which the lord your god is giving you you shall not murder you shall not commit adultery with somebody s spouse you shall not steal you shall not bear false witness against your neighbor you shall not covet your neighbor s wife and you shall not desire your neighbor s house his field his male servant his female servant his ox his donkey or anything that is your neighbor s these words the lord spoke to all your assembly in the mountain from the midst of the fire the cloud and the thick darkness with a loud voice and he added no more and he wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me differences in teachings and interpretation these commandments are translated from ancient hebrew to basic english so the exact words chosen may not mean to us exactly what they meant to the hebrews there are a variety of interpretations of these commandments images the creation of the sun and the moon is a fresco in the sistine chapel it was done by michelangelo it shows an image of god one understanding on the commandment to not make any image or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above is as from roman catholicism they hold that likenesses may be built and used as long as the object is not worshipped the eastern orthodox church has a very similar position eastern orthodoxy teaches that the incarnation of an invisible god as a visible human jesus makes it alright to worship images see iconoclasm but for jews muslims and most other christians that violates the commandment jehovah s witnesses criticize the use of all of the above as well as the use of the cross the amish forbid any sort of image such as photos sabbath day jews honor the sabbath shabbat from sundown on friday until the appearance of three stars in the sky on saturday night the seventh day of the week on the jewish calendar most christians honor the sabbath on sunday to remember the resurrection of jesus on the first day of the week on the jewish calendar some conservative christians are sabbatarians most of these follow the reformed traditions sabbatarians think the first day of the week or lord s day is the new sabbath because the th commandment has never been revoked and sabbath keeping is in any case a creation ordinance others believe that the sabbath remains as a day of rest on saturday while sunday as a day of worship in reference to acts the disciples came together on the first day of the week to break bread and to hear the preaching of the apostle paul also jesus appeared to his followers on the first day of the week while they were in hiding the seventh day adventist church and some others believe that the custom of meeting for worship on sunday originated in paganism specifically sol invictus and mithraism in which sun god worship took place on sunday instead adventists keep saturday as the sabbath as a memorial to god s work of creation believing that none of the ten commandments can ever be destroyed seventh day sabbatarians claim that the seventh day sabbath was kept by the majority of christian groups until the nd and rd century but because of opposition to judaism after the jewish roman wars the original custom was gradually replaced by sunday as the day of worship married relations to be false to the married relation called adultery is when a married person has sexual relations with a person other than his or her spouse having sex without marriage is fornication and is a sin king james bible the original unchanged english version he taught his audience that the outward act of adultery does not happen apart from sins of the heart from within people from their hearts come evil thoughts unchastity theft murder adultery greed malice deceit licentiousness envy blasphemy arrogance folly all these evils come from within and they defile in the new testament jesus says but i say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart killing or murder there are different translations of this commandment the hebrew words are translated either as thou shal not kill or thou shalt not murder older protestant translations of the bible those based on the vulgate and roman catholic translations usually translate it thou shalt not kill the catholic church believes that endangerment of human life or safety e g by drunkenness a love of speed on the road at sea or in the air or gross negligence is a mortal sin that breaks the fifth commandment this includes things such as all air forces in the world use of atomic weapons or drone warfare furthermore the catholic church does not believe in a difference between murder and manslaughter the way the law does with the exceptions of killing in self defense a form of manslaughter in many nations laws and killing in war but not with air force atomic weapons or drone warfare the catholic church believes all other forms of killing or attempting to kill violate the fifth commandment another example of violating the fifth commandment would be driving on an interstate highway or autobahn jewish and newer protestant versions tend to use you shall not murder there are different opinions as to which translation is more faithful to the original the many examples in the old testament of killing sanctioned by god are quoted in defense of the view that murder is more accurate furthermore the hebrew word for kill is harog while the hebrew word for murder is retzach which is found in the ten commandments lo tirtzach stealing many theologians such as german old testament scholar a alt das verbot des diebstahls im dekalog suggest that commandment you shall not steal was originally intended against stealing people abductions and slavery this would be the same as the jewish interpretation of the statement as you shall not kidnap e g as stated by rashi it has also been pointed out time and again that people such as horse thieves or buffalo hunters on the great plains of north america were both stealing and therefore breaking this commandment furthermore horse thievery in that era could get a man hanged as it deprived the victim of the ability to fend for himself false witness to give false witness called lying includes all lying with the exception of a white lie lying in court is called perjury to knowingly give a false truth different numbering the bible does not number the commandments different religious groups have numbered them in different ways the jews followed by christian protestants end the first commandment with you are to have no other gods but me as above catholics and lutherans end the first commandment at i will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws and separate in their last two commandments the desire for a man s wife from the desire for other things he owns the commandments passage in exodus has more than ten important statements there are or in all while the bible itself gives the count as using the hebrew phrase aseret had varim translated as the words statements or things this phrase does not appear in the passages usually presented as being the ten commandments various religions divide the commandments differently the table below shows those differences division of the ten commandments by religion denomination commandment jewish orthodox roman catholic lutheran most other christians i am the lord your god preface you shall have no other gods before me you shall not make for yourself an idol and worship it you shall not make wrongful use of the name of your god remember the sabbath and keep it holy honor your father and mother you shall not murder you shall not commit adultery with somebody s spouse you shall not steal you shall not bear false witness against your neighbor you shall not covet your neighbor s house you shall not covet your neighbor s wife notes the roman catholic church uses the translation kill less specific than murder the roman catholic church combine the original nd commandment with the st commandment although no single biblical passage contains a complete definition of idolatry the subject is addressed in numerous passages so that idolatry may be summarized as the worship of idols or images the worship of polytheistic gods by use of idols or images e g ancient greek gods and their statues in abrahamic religions namely christianity islam and judaism idolatry connotes the worship of something or someone other than god as if it were god and moving the rd to th commandment down into nd to th while dividing the original th commandment into two commandments re arranging them into th and th instead some lutheran churches use a slightly different division of the ninth and tenth commandments thou shalt not covet thy neighbor s house you shall not covet your neighbor s wife or his workers or his cattle or anything that is your neighbor s other religions in general religions other than those mentioned judaism christianity islam do not recognise the ten commandments as ethical standards many of them buddhism hinduism jainism etc have similar laws or principles though in the atheist soviet union the moral code of the builder of communism was a set of rules that resembled the ten commandments comparison between the ten commandments and the buddhist five precepts ten commandments buddhist five precepts i am the lord your god you shall have no other gods before me you shall not make for yourself an idol you shall not make wrongful use of the name of your god remember the sabbath and keep it holy honor your father and mother you shall not murder abstain from hurting and killing both human and animals you shall not commit adultery abstain from sexual misconduct you shall not covet your neighbor s wife you shall not steal abstain from taking what is not given e g stealing displacements that may cause misunderstandings you shall not covet your neighbor s house you shall not bear false witness against your neighbor abstain from bad speech e g telling lies hurting words deceiving manipulating abstain from intoxicating drugs and drinks which lead to carelessness the ritual decalogue the term ten commandments generally applies to the list mentioned in exodus and deuteronomy however there is a continuous story being told starting in exodus where the stones are created exodus where the tablets are broken and exodus this story lists a very different set of commandments this version is sometimes called ritual decalogue johann wolfgang von goethe and the people after him who followed the documentary hypothesis note that exodus seems to refer to these ten commandments rather than the traditional ones these people thought that the commandments in exodus and deuteronomy show a later set of ten commandments and that the ten listed in exodus were the original ten commandments now known as the ritual decalogue as opposed to the better known ethical decalogue the differences between the two decalogues highlight the development of sacred texts over a long time and from differing narrative traditions by incorporating two differing sets of ten commandments influence the commandments have influenced jewish ethics and law and through judaism and christianity western ethics and law since the roman empire in the arts movies there have been two famous movie called the ten commandments they both were directed by cecil b demille the first was a silent movie in and the second in starring charlton heston as moses was the biggest money making movie of that year in animation in the anime series seven deadly sins a japanese manga and anime by mangaka nakaba suzuki there is a group of characters called the ten commandments these individuals all possess a title and supernatural ability named after each commandment references other websites the ten commandments at the website of the vatican trees around a lake the trembling aspen in its autumn colours strangler fig tree in costa rica locally known as guanacaste and this shows how the strangler fig grows a tree is a tall plant with a trunk and branches made of wood trees can live for many years the oldest tree ever discovered is approximately years old and the oldest tree from the uk is about the four main parts of a tree are the roots the trunk the branches and the leaves the roots of a tree are usually under the ground however this is not always true the roots of the mangrove tree are often under water or on the sides of cliffs a single tree has many roots the roots carry nutrients and water from the ground through the trunk and branches to the leaves of the tree they can also breathe in air sometimes roots are specialized into aerial roots which can also provide support as is the case with the banyan tree the trunk is the main body of the tree the trunk is covered with bark which protects it from damage branches grow from the trunk they spread out so that the leaves can get more sunlight the trunk also sways slightly in the wind to prevent it from falling over the leaves of a tree are green most of the time but they can come in many colors shapes and sizes the leaves take in sunlight and use water and food from the roots to make the tree grow and to reproduce trees and shrubs take in water and carbon dioxide and give out oxygen with sunlight to form sugars this is the opposite of what animals do in respiration plants also do some respiration using oxygen the way animals do they need oxygen as well as carbon dioxide to live parts of trees branches and twigs beech leaves tree roots anchor the structure and provide water and nutrients the ground has eroded away around the roots of this young pine tree the dark lines between the centre and the bark are medullary rays which allow nutrients to flow across the tree trunk the parts of a tree are the roots trunk s branches twigs and leaves tree stems are mainly made of support and transport tissues xylem and phloem wood consists of xylem cells and bark is made of phloem and other tissues external to the vascular cambium growth of the trunk as a tree grows it may produce growth rings as new wood is laid down around the old wood in areas with seasonal climate wood produced at different times of the year may alternate light and dark rings in temperate climates and tropical climates with a single wet dry season alternation the growth rings are annual each pair of light and dark rings being one year of growth in areas with two wet and dry seasons each year there may be two pairs of light and dark rings each year and in some mainly semi desert regions with irregular rainfall there may be a new growth ring with each rainfall in tropical rainforest regions with constant year round climate growth is continuous growth rings are not visible and there is no change in the wood texture in species with annual rings these rings can be counted to find the age of the tree this way wood taken from trees in the past can be dated because the patterns of ring thickness are very distinctive this is dendrochronology very few tropical trees can be accurately dated in this manner roots the roots of a tree are almost always underground usually in a ball shaped region centered under the trunk and extending no deeper than the tree is high roots can also be above ground or deep underground some roots are short some are meters long roots provide support for the parts above ground holding the tree upright and keeping it from falling over in high wind roots take in water and nutrients from the soil without help from fungus for better uptake of nutrients trees would be small or would die most trees have a favorite species of fungus that they associate with for this purpose branches above ground the trunk gives height to the leaf bearing branches competing with other plant species for sunlight in all trees the shape of the branches improves the exposure of the leaves to sunlight branches start at the trunk big and thick and get progressively smaller the farther they grow from the trunk branches themselves split into smaller branches sometime very many times until at the end they are quite small the small ends are called twigs leaves the leaves of a tree are held by the branches leaves are usually held at the ends of the branches the although some have leaves along the branches the main functions of leaves are photosynthesis and gas exchange a leaf is often flat so it absorbs the most light and thin so that the sunlight can get to the green parts in the cells which convert sunlight carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water from the roots into glucose and oxygen most of a tree s biomass comes from this process most leaves have stomata which open and close and regulate carbon dioxide oxygen and water vapour exchange with the atmosphere trees with leaves all year round are evergreens and those that shed their leaves are deciduous deciduous trees and shrubs generally lose their leaves in autumn as it gets cold before this happens the leaves change colour the leaves will grow back in spring exceptions the word tree in english means a long lived plant having obvious main stem and growing to a considerable height and size thus not all trees have all the organs or parts as mentioned above for example most tree like palms are not branched and tree ferns do not produce bark there are also more exceptions based on their general shape and size all of these are nonetheless generally regarded as trees trees can vary a lot a plant that is similar to a tree but generally smaller and may have multiple trunks or have branches that arise near the ground is called a shrub or a bush since these are common english words there is no precise differentiation between shrubs and trees given their small size bonsai plants would not technically be trees but are indeed trees do not confuse the use of tree for a species of plant with the size or shape of individual specimens a spruce seedling does not fit the definition of a tree but all spruces are trees classification a sweet chestnut tree in ticino switzerland a tree is a plant form that can be found in many different orders and families of plants trees show many growth forms leaf type and shape bark traits and organs the tree form has changed separately in classes of plants that are not related in response to similar problems for the tree with about types of trees the number of tree types in the whole world might be one fourth of all living plant types most tree species grow in tropical parts of the world and many of these areas have not been surveyed yet by botanists they study plants making species difference and ranges not well understood the earliest trees were tree ferns horsetails and lycophytes which grew in forests in the carboniferous period tree ferns still survive but the only surviving horsetails and lycophytes are not of tree form later in the triassic period conifers ginkgos cycads and other gymnosperms appeared and subsequently flowering plants in the cretaceous period most species of trees today are flowering plants angiosperms and conifers a small group of trees growing together is called a grove or copse and a landscape covered by a dense growth of trees is called a forest several biotopes are defined largely by the trees that inhabit them examples are rainforest and taiga see ecozones a landscape of trees scattered or spaced across grassland usually grazed or burned over periodically is called a savanna a forest of great age is called old growth forest or ancient woodland in the uk a very young tree is called a sapling records height scientists in the uk and malaysia say they have discovered the world s tallest tropical tree measuring more than m ft high a coast redwood in redwood national park california had been measured as tallest but may no longer be standing the tallest trees in australia are all eucalypts of which there are more than species the so called mountain ash with a slim straight trunk grows to over feet stoutest trees the stoutest living single trunk species in diameter is the african baobab glencoe baobab measured near the ground limpopo province south africa this tree split up in november and now the stoutest baobab could be sunland baobab south africa with diameter m and circumference of m some trees develop multiple trunks whether from an individual tree or multiple trees which grow together the sacred fig is a notable example of this forming additional trunks by growing adventitious roots down from the branches which then thicken up when the root reaches the ground to form new trunks a single sacred fig tree can have hundreds of such trunks age of trees the life span of trees is determined by growth rings these can be seen if the tree is cut down or in cores taken from the edge to the center of the tree correct determination is only possible for trees which make growth rings generally those which occur in seasonal climates trees in uniform non seasonal tropical climates are always growing and do not have distinct growth rings it is also only possible for trees which are solid to the center of the tree many very old trees become hollow as the dead heartwood decays away for some of these species age estimates have been made on the basis of extrapolating current growth rates but the results are usually little better than guesses or speculation white proposed a method of estimating the age of large and veteran trees in the united kingdom by correlation between a tree s stem diameter growth character and age the verified oldest measured ages are great basin bristlecone pine methuselah pinus longaeva years alerce years giant sequoia years sugi years huon pine years other species suspected of reaching exceptional age include european yew taxus baccata probably over years and western redcedar thuja plicata the oldest known european yew is the llangernyw yew in the churchyard of llangernyw village in north wales which is estimated to be between and years old the oldest reported age for an angiosperm tree is years for the sri maha bodhi sacred fig ficus religiosa planted in bc at anuradhapura sri lanka this is said to be the oldest human planted tree with a known planting date tree value estimation studies have shown that trees contribute as much as of the appraised land value in certain markets basic tree values varies by region diameter inches value us these most likely use diameter measured at breast height dbh feet cm above ground not the larger base diameter a general model for any year and diameter is assuming inflation per year tree climbing tree climbing is an activity where one moves around in the crown of trees a tree climber use of a rope helmet and harness are the minimum requirements to ensure the safety of the climber other equipment can also be used depending on the experience and skill of the tree climber some tree climbers take special hammocks called treeboats and portaledges with them into the tree canopies where they can enjoy a picnic or nap or spend the night tree climbing is an on rope activity that puts together many different tricks and gear originally derived from rock climbing and caving these techniques are used to climb trees for many purposes including tree care arborists animal rescue recreation sport research and activism damage massive though not the tallest eucalyptus regnans was accidentally killed by loggers burning off the remains of legally loggable trees less than ft that had been felled all around it the three big sources of tree damage are biotic from living sources abiotic from non living sources and deforestation cutting trees down biotic sources would include insects which might bore into the tree deer which might rub bark off the trunk or fungi which might attach themselves to the tree abiotic sources include lightning vehicles impacts and construction activities construction activities can involve a number of damage sources including grade changes that prevent aeration to roots spills involving toxic chemicals such as cement or petroleum products or severing of branches or roots people can damage trees also both damage sources can result in trees becoming dangerous and the term hazard trees is commonly used by arborists and industry groups such as power line operators hazard trees are trees which due to disease or other factors are more susceptible to falling during windstorms or having parts of the tree fall the process of finding the danger a tree presents is based on a process called the quantified tree risk assessment trees are similar to people both can take a lot of some types of damage and survive but even small amounts of certain types of trauma can result in death arborists are very aware that established trees will not tolerate any appreciable disturbance of the root system even though that is true most people and construction professionals do not realize how easily a tree can be killed one reason for confusion about tree damage from construction involves the dormancy of trees during winter another factor is that trees may not show symptoms of damage until months or longer after damage has occurred for that reason persons who do not know about caring for trees may not link the actual cause with the later damaged effect various organizations have long recognized the importance of construction activities that impact tree health the impacts are important because they can result in monetary losses due to tree damage and resultant remediation or replacement costs as well as violation of government ordinances or community or subdivision restrictions as a result protocols standard ways for tree management prior to during and after construction activities are well established tested and refined changed these basic steps are involved review of the construction plans development of the related tree inventory application of standard construction tree management protocols assessment of potential for expected tree damages development of a tree protection plan providing for pre concurrent and post construction damage prevention and remediation steps development of a tree protection plan development of a remediation plan implementation of tree protection zones tpzs assessment of construction tree damage post construction implementation of the remediation plan trees in culture the tree has always been a cultural symbol common icons are the world tree for instance yggdrasil and the tree of life the tree is often used to represent nature or the environment itself a common mistake wrong thing is that trees get most of their mass from the ground in fact of a tree s mass comes from the air wishing trees a wish tree or wishing tree is a single tree usually distinguished by species position or appearance which is used as an object of wishes and offerings such trees are identified as possessing a special religious or spiritual value by tradition believers make votive offerings in order to gain from that nature spirit saint or goddess fulfillment of a wish tree worship tree worship refers to the tendency of many societies in all of history to worship or otherwise mythologize trees trees have played a very important role in many of the world s mythologies and religions and have been given deep and sacred meanings throughout the ages human beings seeing the growth and death of trees the elasticity of their branches the sensitiveness and the annual every year decay and revival of their foliage see them as powerful symbols of growth decay and resurrection the most ancient cross cultural symbolic representation of the universe s construction is the world tree world tree yggdrasil the world ash norse the tree with its branches reaching up into the sky and roots deep into the earth can be seen to dwell in three worlds a link between heaven the earth and the underworld uniting above and below it is also both a feminine symbol bearing sustenance and a masculine phallic symbol another union for this reason many mythologies around the world have the concept of the world tree a great tree that acts as an axis mundi holding up the cosmos and providing a link between the heavens earth and underworld in european mythology the best known example is the tree yggdrasil from norse mythology the world tree is also an important part of mesoamerican mythologies where it represents the four cardinal directions north south east and west the concept of the world tree is also closely linked to the motif of the tree of life in literature in literature a mythology was notably developed by j r r tolkien his two trees of valinor playing a central role in his tree and leaf william butler yeats describes a holy tree in his poem the two trees list of trees there are many types of trees here is a list of some of them

heroine or others a tragedy is usually about a person who has many good qualities but has one poor quality called a tragic flaw that causes trouble for him and maybe his family or friends often in a tragedy there is one possible event that the hero fears and tries to prevent but no matter what he does it makes this thing more and more sure to happen tragedies originated in ancient greek theatre where they were performed at religious festivals the three most famous greek tragedy writers were aeschylus sophocles and euripides later famous writers include shakespeare and jean racine sometimes the word tragedy is also used to mean something with a bad outcome in real life related pages english renaissance drama henrik ibsen arthur miller the hierarchy of scientific classification taxonomy is a branch of science it is about the laws and principles of classifying things from one type of taxonomy many classifications might be produced the best known kind of taxonomy is used for the classification of lifeforms living and extinct each organism has a scientific name this name is part of the biological classification of that species the name is the same all over the world so scientists from different places can understand each other in addition a species has a position in the tree of life thus the crow is corvus corone a member of the corvidae family and they are passerine birds that is well agreed but the classification of some groups is not agreed at present and often several classifications are being discussed living things are classified into three domains bacteria archaea and eukaryotes the highest rank in a domain is the kingdom each kingdom has many smaller groups in it called phyla each phylum has more smaller groups in it called classes this pattern looks like branches on a tree with smaller branches growing from them each species is put into a group because of what it does how and what it eats special body parts and so on at the end of the pattern the groups genera are very small then each species in the genus is given its own name when someone writes about a living thing and its formal scientific name they write the genus and species name this is known as binomial nomenclature because it uses two names for each organism the first is the genus name and the second is the species in that genus the scientific name of the domestic cat is felis catus sometimes it is enough to write f catus these are the major groups ranks used in taxonomy kingdom phylum class order family genus species some mnemonics sayings to help a person remember something king phillip came over from greater spain when people started naming species latin was a language widely used in europe all species names are still written in latin this has some advantages since latin is no longer spoken it is unchanging and is owned by no one it gets over the problem of every language having its own names for animals and plants scientists used to write the official description of each new species in latin on january the international botanical congress changed to allow english as well as latin for describing new plant species the international code of zoological nomenclature recommends choosing a language that is widely used and that is used in the places where the species lives cladism an important modern approach to taxonomy is cladism this approach is based on the branching tree like course of evolution like traditional linnaean classification it uses traits to decide on the branches of the classification it insists on groups being monophyletic this has the effect that birds are not a class but a sub group of dinosaurs it also means the ranking system described above would be abolished so cladism has different principles of taxonomy and produces a different kind of taxonomy decisions where possible are supported by dna sequence analysis present day biological classification is a mixture of the old linnaean and the modern cladistic principles of taxonomy in parts it is changing rapidly the classifications presented in wikipedia at present are often a compromise between the two systems the details are regularly discussed turmoil in taxonomy today there are many changes in the classification of living things this turmoil in taxonomy has led to many alternative classifications it is caused partly from the move from linnaean to cladistic principles and partly by the use of dna sequence data in taxonomy an example is the way derived groups like birds should not be classified at the same level as the group they evolved from yet birds have traditionally been a class under the linnaean system the turmoil sometimes results in differences between related pages pages may rely on different references and

involve theft stealing is basic and is illegal almost everywhere thieves steal things sometimes because they want to have something for themselves or because they want to sell something for money sometimes thieves will come up with plans to rob a store bank house or person and sometimes they will just see a chance to steal something and take it some thieves have an impulse control disorder

four separate countries england wales scotland and northern ireland it is a member of the european union united nations the commonwealth nato and the g it has the fifth largest economy in the world around million people live in the uk they can be divided into four big nationalities based on the countries where they live these countries and the names of the people and language spoken there are as follows england is the biggest country and the one where most people in the uk live people who live in england are called english their native language is called english which is spoken by almost everyone in the uk and has become a global lingua franca a few people in the southwest part of england can speak cornish a celtic language scotland to the north of england is the second biggest country people who live here are called scottish and some speak languages called scottish gaelic a celtic language or scots which is a lot like english but is different from it wales is to the west of england its people are called welsh and have their own celtic language which is also called welsh not everyone in wales can speak welsh but almost everyone can speak english northern ireland is the smallest country unlike the other three it is not on the island of great britain it is part of the island ireland northern ireland takes up about a sixth of ireland with the republic of ireland taking up the remainder people who live in northern ireland are either irish british or northern irish it is their choice what they want to be identified as the people who live there usually speak english but some people speak irish and ulster scots which is similar to scots spoken in scotland but with some differences between the th and mid th centuries britain was a world power it became a colonial empire that controlled large areas of africa asia north america and oceania many countries left and became independent from the empire in the th century although britain keeps links with most countries of its former empire the uk has many cities england is home to london the biggest city in the uk and also its capital city there are also many other big cities in england including birmingham manchester liverpool leeds bristol and newcastle upon tyne scotland has the big cities of edinburgh and glasgow cardiff and swansea are in wales and belfast is in northern ireland the uk had a dominating empire named the british empire at its height in more than million people lived in the british empire one fifth of the earth s population its area was sq mi almost a quarter of the earth s land area the british empire was often called the empire on which the sun never sets that describes a large empire because the sun is always shining on at least one of its territories prehistory stonehenge in the united kingdom archaeological remains show that the first group of modern people to live in the british isles were hunter gatherers after the last ice age ended the date is not known perhaps as early as bc but certainly by bc they built mesolithic wood and stone monuments stonehenge was built between and bc celtic tribes arrived from mainland europe britain was a changing collection of tribal areas with no overall leader julius caesar tried to invade take over the island in bc but was not able to do so the romans successfully invaded in ad history written history began in britain when writing was brought to britain by the romans rome ruled in britain from ad to ad but they only ruled england and wales the romans never ruled scotland north of the clyde forth valley or ireland their northern boundary varied from time to time and was marked for a while at hadrian s wall after the romans two waves of immigrants came to britain the first were german tribes the angles saxons and jutes english the language is a development from anglo saxon old english and is a germanic language the second were the vikings britain unified after a long period when england was split into various kingdoms it was made into one country by thelstan athelstan in ad england and wales were unified by edward i longshanks by force in the th century union with scotland took much longer there were hundreds of years of conflicts between both parts of britain this union between england and scotland in formed the united kingdom of great britain which merged scotland and england into one country in when queen elizabeth i of england died her closest relative was king james vi of scotland he became king of england as well as king of scotland in the scottish and english parliaments agreed the treaty of union which joined the two countries into one country called the kingdom of great britain under queen anne queen elizabeth has reigned since by both scotland and england had already independently had much influence over ireland since in that year laws were passed in great britain and ireland to merge the two states the new country was called the united kingdom of great britain and ireland in much of ireland became independent as the irish free state now called ireland from the united kingdom however six northern counties called northern ireland continue to be part of the united kingdom the country was renamed the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland parliament the british people are represented by members of parliament not ruled by monarchs however after the english civil war oliver cromwell became lord protector and the monarchy was disbanded though the monarchy was restored after his death the crown slowly became the secondary power and parliament the first members of parliament called mps were elected but until the early twentieth century only men who owned property could vote in the nineteenth century more people were given suffrage the right to vote but even so by women could not vote and only of men were rich enough to vote but in all adults male and female got the vote this is called universal suffrage parliament is in london but it has power over the whole of the uk today wales scotland and northern ireland each have their own seats of local government but they have more limited powers scotland has the self named scottish parliament the welsh have an assembly and the northern irish have stormount there isn t an individual english parliament representing the views of only english regions there are also parliaments in the isle of man and the channel islands which are islands that are partly controlled by the uk and partly independent the members of parliament belong to political parties the biggest parties are the conservative party labour party the scottish national party and the liberal democrats members of the same party agree to act and vote more or less together a party with more than half the seats a majority forms the government the leader of the party becomes the prime minister who then appoints other ministers because the government has a majority in parliament it can

the uk are the north sea the english channel and the atlantic ocean the uk also rules usually indirectly a number of smaller places mostly islands round the world which are known as overseas territories they are remnants of the british empire the weather of the united kingdom is changeable and unpredictable summers are moderately warm winters are cool to cold rain falls throughout the year and more on the west than the east because of its northerly latitude and the warm water from the atlantic ocean s gulf stream the usually moderate prevailing winds from the atlantic may be

is boris johnson since the uk is a parliamentary democracy based on a constitutional and hereditary monarchy the people of the united kingdom vote for a members of parliament to speak for them and to make laws for them queen elizabeth ii is the queen of the uk and is the head of state even though she is the head of state she does not actually govern the country the government led by the prime minister governs the country and decides policy today the prime minister is boris johnson who is the leader of the conservative party and was not directly elected by the people of the country parliament is where laws are made it has three parts the house of commons the house of lords and the queen the house of commons is the most powerful part it is where members of parliament sit the prime minister sits here as well because they are a member of parliament the people who sit in the house of lords are called peers they are not chosen by the people most peers are now appointed by the government there are some who are hereditary peers their fathers were peers and a few others such as certain bishops in the established church of england and the judiciary law lords scotland has its own devolved parliament with power to make laws on things like education health and scottish law northern ireland and wales have their own devolved assemblies which have some powers but less than the scottish parliament the uk parliament remains sovereign and it could end the devolved administrations at any time military the uk has a military of around people not including reserve forces the uk has one of the most advanced militaries in the world alongside such countries such as the usa and france and operates a large army british army a sizable navy royal navy and air force royal air force from the th century to the early th century the uk was one of the most powerful nations in the world with a huge navy due to the fact it was surrounded by sea so a large navy was the most practical option this status has faded in recent times but the uk remains a member of various military groups such as the un security council and nato it is also still seen as a great military power economy the uk is a developed country with the sixth largest economy in the world it was a superpower during the th th and early th century and was considered since the early s to be the most powerful and influential nation in the world in politics economics for it was the wealthiest country at the time and in military strength britain continued to be the biggest manufacturing economy in the world until and the largest economy until the s the economic cost of two world wars and the decline of the british empire in the s and s reduced its leading role in global affairs the uk has strong economic cultural military and political influence and is a nuclear power it is a member state of the european union at the moment but is planning on leaving after brexit was voted for the uk holds a permanent

from edinburgh the poet dylan thomas brought welsh culture to international attention education england northern ireland scotland and wales have separate but similar systems of education they all have rules that education is required from ages five to eighteen except for in scotland where school departure is allowed from the age of sixteen many children attend state schools and other children attend private schools britain s universities are the university of cambridge and university of oxford and london universities university college london the london school of economics king s college london and imperial college london which collectively form the golden triangle of uk universities a broader group of twenty universities form the russell group which account for two thirds of research grants and contract funding out of the total of universities transport road traffic in the united kingdom drives on the left hand side of the road unlike the americas and some of europe and the driver steers from the right hand side of the vehicle the road network on the island of great britain is extensive with most local and rural roads having evolved from roman and medieval times major routes developed in the mid th century were made to the needs of the motor car the high speed motorway freeway network was mostly constructed in the s and s and links together major towns and cities the system of rail transport was invented in england and wales so the united kingdom has the oldest railway network in the world it was built mostly during the victorian era at the heart of the network are five long distance main lines which radiate from london to the major cities and secondary population centres with dense commuter networks within the regions the newest part of the network connects london to the channel tunnel from st pancras station and is built to the same standard as the french tgv system the british rail network is part privatised with privately owned train operating companies providing service along particular lines or regions whilst the tracks signals and stations are owned by a government controlled company called network rail in northern ireland the ni railways is the national railway the system of underground railways in london known as the tube has been copied by many other cities most domestic air travel in the united kingdom is between london and the major cities in scotland and the north of england and belfast london heathrow is the nation s largest airport and is one of the most important international hubs in the world other major airports with principal international service include london gatwick birmingham manchester and glasgow an extensive system of ferry networks operate between the scottish islands and major ferry routes

name that we use to describe the collection of all the things that exist in space it is made of many millions of millions of stars and planets and enormous clouds of gas separated by a gigantic empty space which is called the universe astronomers can use telescopes to look at very distant galaxies this is how they see what the universe looked like a long time ago this is because the light from distant parts of the universe takes a very long time to reach us from these observations it seems the physical laws and constants of the universe have not changed physicists are currently unsure if anything existed before the big bang they are also unsure whether the size of the universe is infinite history many people in history had ideas to explain the universe most early models had the earth at the centre of the universe some ancient greeks thought that the universe has infinite space and has existed forever they thought it had a set of spheres which corresponded to the fixed stars the sun and various planets the spheres circled about a spherical but unmoving earth over the centuries better observations and better ideas of gravity led to copernicus s sun centred model this was hugely controversial at the time and was fought long and hard by authorities of the christian church see giordano bruno and galileo the invention of the telescope in the netherlands was a milestone in astronomy by the mid th century they were good enough for other galaxies to be distinguished the modern optical uses visible light telescope is still more advanced meanwhile the newtonian dynamics equations showed how the solar system worked the improvement of telescopes led astronomers to realize that the solar system is in a galaxy made of billions of stars the milky way and that other galaxies exist outside it as far as we can see careful studies of the distribution of these galaxies and their spectral lines have led to much of modern cosmology discovery of the systematic redshift of galaxies led to the conclusion that the universe is expanding see hubble high resolution image of the hubble ultra deep field it shows a variety of galaxies each made of billions of stars the equivalent area of sky that the picture occupies is shown in the lower left corner the smallest reddest galaxies about are some of the most distant galaxies to have been photographed they formed shortly after the big bang big bang the most used scientific model of the universe is known as the big bang theory the universe expanded from in which all the matter and energy of the universe was concentrated several independent experimental measurements support the expansion of space and more generally the big bang idea recent observations support the idea that this expansion is happening because of most of the matter in the universe may be in a form which cannot be detected by present methods this has been named just to be clear dark matter and energy have not been detected directly that is why they are called dark their existence is from observations which would be difficult to explain otherwise according to space can get bigger faster than the speed of light but we can view only part of the universe because of the speed of light we cannot see space beyond the limitations of light or any electromagnetic radiation the diameter of the universe is at least billion it is estimated that the age of the universe is billion years and that the diameter of the universe is at least billion light years or metres etymology synonyms and meaning the word universe comes from the old french word univers which comes from the latin word universum the latin word was used by cicero and later latin authors in many of the same senses as the modern english word is used a different interpretation way to interpret of unvorsum is everything rotated as one or everything rotated by one this refers to an early greek model of the universe in that model all matter was in rotating spheres centered on the earth according to aristotle the rotation of the outermost sphere was responsible for the motion and change of everything within it was natural for the greeks to assume that the earth was stationary and that the heavens rotated about the earth because careful astronomical and physical measurements such as the foucault pendulum are required to prove otherwise the most common term for universe among the ancient greek philosophers from pythagoras onwards was the all defined as all matter and all space broadest meaning the broadest word meaning of the universe is found in de divisione naturae by the medieval philosopher johannes scotus eriugena who defined it as simply everything everything that exists and everything that does not exist time is not considered in eriugena s definition thus his definition includes everything that exists has existed and will exist as well as everything that does not exist has never existed and will never exist this all embracing definition was not adopted by most later philosophers but something similar is in quantum physics definition as reality usually the universe is thought to be everything that exists has existed and will exist this definition says that the universe is made of two elements space and time together known as space time or the vacuum and matter and different forms of energy and momentum occupying space time the two kinds of elements behave according to physical laws in which we describe how the elements interact a similar definition of the term universe is everything that exists at a single moment of time such as the present or the beginning of time as in the sentence the universe was of size in aristotle s book the physics aristotle divided everything into three roughly analogous elements matter the stuff of which the universe is made form the arrangement of that matter in space and change how matter is created destroyed or altered in its properties and similarly how form is altered physical laws were the rules governing the properties of matter form and their changes later philosophers such as lucretius averroes avicenna and baruch spinoza altered or refined these divisions for example averroes and spinoza have active principles governing the universe which act on passive elements space time definitions it is possible to form space times each existing but not able to touch move or change interact with each other an easy way to think of this is a group of separate soap bubbles in which people living on one soap bubble cannot interact with those on other soap bubbles according to one common terminology each soap bubble of space time is denoted as a universe whereas our particular space time is denoted as the universe just as we call our moon the moon the entire collection of these separate space times is denoted as the multiverse in principle the other unconnected universes may have different dimensionalities and topologies of space time different forms of matter and energy and different physical laws and physical constants although such possibilities are speculations observable reality according to a still more restrictive definition the universe is everything within our connected space time that could have a chance to interact with us and vice versa according to the general idea of relativity some regions of space may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the universe due to the finite speed of light and the ongoing expansion of space for example radio messages sent from earth may never reach some regions of space even if the universe would exist forever space may expand faster than light can traverse it it is worth emphasizing that those distant regions of space are taken to exist and be part of reality as much as we are yet we can never interact with them even in principle the spatial region within which we can affect and be affected is denoted as the observable universe strictly speaking the observable universe depends on the location of the observer by traveling an observer can come into contact with a greater region of space time than an observer who remains still so that the observable universe for the former is larger than for the latter nevertheless even the most rapid traveler may not be able to interact with all of space typically the observable universe means the universe seen from our vantage point in the milky way galaxy basic data on the universe the universe is thought to be mostly made of dark energy and dark matter both of which are not understood right now less than of the universe is ordinary matter the elementary particles from which the universe is constructed six leptons and six quarks comprise most of the matter for example the protons and neutrons of atomic nuclei are composed of quarks and the ubiquitous electron is a lepton these particles interact via the gauge bosons shown in the middle row each corresponding to a particular type of gauge symmetry the higgs boson as yet unobserved is believed to confer mass on the particles with which it is connected the graviton a supposed gauge boson for gravity is not shown the universe is huge and possibly infinite in volume the matter which can be seen is spread over a space at least billion light years across for comparison the diameter of a typical galaxy is only light years and the typical distance between two neighboring galaxies is only million light years as an example our milky way galaxy is roughly light years in diameter and our nearest sister galaxy the andromeda galaxy is located roughly million light years away there are probably more than billion galaxies in the observable universe typical galaxies range from dwarf galaxies with as few as ten million stars up to giants with one trillion stars all orbiting the galaxy s center of mass thus a very rough estimate from these numbers would suggest there are around one sextillion stars in the observable universe though a study by australian national university astronomers resulted in a figure of sextillion x the matter that can be seen is spread throughout the universe when averaged over distances longer than million light years however on smaller length scales matter is observed to form clumps many atoms are condensed into stars most stars into galaxies most galaxies into galaxy groups and clusters and lastly the largest scale structures such as the great wall of galaxies the present overall density of the universe is very low roughly grams per cubic centimetre this mass energy appears to consist of dark energy cold dark matter and ordinary matter the density of atoms is about a single hydrogen atom for every four cubic meters of volume the properties of dark energy and dark matter are not known dark matter slows the expansion of the universe dark energy makes its expansion faster the universe is old and changing the best good guess of the universe s age is billion years old based on what was seen of the cosmic microwave background radiation independent estimates based on measurements such as radioactive dating agree although they are less precise ranging from billion years to billion years the universe has not been the same at all times in its history this getting bigger accounts for how earth bound people can see the light from a galaxy billion light years away even if that light has traveled for only billion years the very space between them has expanded this expansion is consistent with the observation that the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted the photons emitted have been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey the rate of this spatial expansion is accelerating based on studies of type ia supernovae and other data the relative amounts of different chemical elements especially the lightest atoms such as hydrogen deuterium and helium seem to be identical in all of the universe and throughout all of the history of it that we know of the universe seems to have much more matter than antimatter the universe appears to have no net electric charge gravity is the dominant interaction at cosmological distances the universe also seems to have no net momentum or angular momentum the absence of net charge and momentum is expected if the universe is finite the universe appears to have a smooth space time continuum made of three spatial dimensions and one temporal time dimension on the average space is very nearly flat close to zero curvature meaning that euclidean geometry is experimentally true with high accuracy throughout most of the universe however the universe may have more dimensions and its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology the universe has the same physical laws and physical constants throughout according to the prevailing standard model of physics all matter is composed of three generations of leptons and quarks both of which are fermions these elementary particles interact via at most three fundamental interactions the electroweak interaction which includes electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force the strong nuclear force described by quantum chromodynamics and gravity which is best described at present by general relativity special relativity holds in all the universe in local space and time otherwise general relativity holds there is no explanation for the particular values that physical constants appear to have throughout our universe such as planck s constant h or the gravitational constant g several conservation laws have been identified such as the conservation of charge conservation of momentum conservation of angular momentum and conservation of energy theoretical models general theory of relativity accurate predictions of the universe s past and future require an accurate theory of gravitation the best theory available is albert einstein s general theory of relativity which has passed all experimental tests so far however since rigorous experiments have not been carried out on cosmological length scales general relativity could conceivably be inaccurate nevertheless its predictions appear to be consistent with observations so there is no reason to adopt another theory general relativity provides of a set of ten nonlinear partial differential equations for the spacetime metric einstein s field equations that must be solved from the distribution of mass energy and momentum throughout the universe since these are unknown in exact detail cosmological models have been based on the cosmological principle which states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic in effect this principle asserts that the gravitational effects of the various galaxies making up the universe are equivalent to those of a fine dust distributed uniformly throughout the universe with the same average density the assumption of a uniform dust makes it easy to solve einstein s field equations and predict the past and future of the universe on cosmological time scales einstein s field equations include a cosmological constant lamda that is related to an energy density of empty space depending on its sign the cosmological constant can either slow negative or accelerate positive the expansion of the universe although many scientists including einstein had speculated that was zero recent astronomical observations of type ia supernovae have detected a large amount of dark energy that is accelerating the universe s expansion preliminary studies suggest that this dark energy is related to a positive although alternative theories cannot be ruled out as yet big bang model the prevailing big bang model accounts for many of the experimental observations described above such as the correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies the universal ratio of hydrogen helium atoms and the ubiquitous isotropic microwave radiation background as noted above the redshift arises from the metric expansion of space as the space itself expands the wavelength of a photon traveling through space likewise increases decreasing its energy the longer a photon has been traveling the more expansion it has undergone hence older photons from more distant galaxies are the most red shifted determining the correlation between distance and redshift is an important problem in experimental physical cosmology other experimental observations can be explained by combining the overall expansion of space with nuclear physics and atomic physics as the universe expands the energy density of the electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that of matter since the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength thus although the energy density of the universe is now dominated by matter it was once dominated by radiation poetically speaking all was light as the universe expanded its energy density decreased and it became cooler as it did so the elementary particles of matter could associate stably into ever larger combinations thus in the early part of the matter dominated era stable protons and neutrons formed which then associated into atomic nuclei at this stage the matter in the universe was mainly a hot dense plasma of negative electrons neutral neutrinos and positive nuclei nuclear reactions among the nuclei led to the present abundances of the lighter nuclei particularly hydrogen deuterium and helium eventually the electrons and nuclei combined to form stable atoms which are transparent to most wavelengths of radiation at this point the radiation decoupled from the matter forming the ubiquitous isotropic background of microwave radiation observed today atomic nuclei observed in the universe other observations are not clearly answered by known physics according to the prevailing theory a slight imbalance of matter over antimatter was present in the universe s creation or developed very shortly thereafter although the matter and antimatter mostly annihilated one another producing photons a small residue of matter survived giving the present matter dominated universe several lines of evidence also suggest that a rapid cosmic inflation of the universe occurred very early in its history roughly seconds after its creation recent observations also suggest that the cosmological constant is not zero and that the net mass energy content of the universe is dominated by a dark energy and dark matter that have not been characterized scientifically they differ in their gravitational effects dark matter gravitates as ordinary matter does and thus slows the expansion of the universe by contrast dark energy serves to accelerate the universe s expansion multiverse some people think that there is more than one universe they think that there is a set of universes called the multiverse by definition there is no way for anything in one universe to affect something in another the multiverse is not yet a scientific idea because there is no way to test it an idea that cannot be tested is not science future the future of the universe is a mystery however there has a couple of theories based on the possible shapes of the universe if the universe is a closed sphere it will stop expanding the universe will do opposite of that and become a singularity for another big bang if the universe is an opened sphere it will speed up the expansion after billion years the universe will rip apart with the force if the universe is flat it will expand forever all stars will lose their energy for that and become a dwarf star after a googol year the black holes will also gone further

museum of natural history this cube can hold one litre of a liquid beer mugs at oktoberfest they hold one litre of beer measurement is a process that uses numbers to describe a physical quantity based on what we can observe this is done to be able to compare them to each other we can measure how big things are how warm they are how heavy they are and lots of other features as well units of measurement provide standards for our comparisons so that the numbers from our measurements refer to the same thing for example the metre is a standard unit to measure length before it was defined as the distance between two markers on a special rod now scientists define the metre by using the speed of light saying something has a length of metres means that it is exactly twice as long as that rod used to define the metre or that light takes twice the time defined for a metre to travel that distance in past centuries many different units were used in different countries today most units of measure fall into one of three systems the older two the british imperial system and the closely related us customary system use the foot as a measure of length the pound as a measure for weight and the second as a measure for time they use other units as well the number of smaller units that make the bigger units in these two systems varies for example there are inches in a foot and ounces in a pound the newest of the three systems is the metric system or si system which usually use or of a smaller unit to make a bigger one for instance there are centimetres in metre or grams in kilogram this system uses the metre for length the kilogram for weight and like the other two systems the second for time number and unit of measure the property of the thing being measured is given as a number of units of measure the number only has sense when the unit of measurement is also given for example the eiffel tower in paris france is meters tall that is the distance from the top to the bottom of the eiffel tower is meters the property of the eiffel tower being measured is a distance the number measured is this number does not make sense without the unit of measure the unit of measure is the meter measurement standards standards are special objects that are used to make measurements in terms of fixed units of measurement a metre stick is an example of a standard when you measure something with a metre stick you can compare that measurement to anything else that is also measured with a metre stick this makes measurement easier and comparisons between measurements easier size of units of measurement there are units of measurement of different sizes there are small units of measurement to measure small things there are big units of measurement to measure big things there are medium units of measurement to measure medium things science medicine and engineering use smaller units of measurement to measure small things with less error it is easy to measure large things using larger units of measurement large measurements like the width of a galaxy and small measurements like the mass of an atom use special units of measurement systems of units of measurement there are many different standards and units used all over the world most became less used during the th and th centuries metric system see si and metric system the metric system is a system of measurement used in most of the world it is also called the international system of units or si units of measure in the metric system include the units of length or linear size are based on the metre they include the kilometre km which is meters the centimetre cm and the millimetre mm which is th of a meter the unit of volume is the litre it is used for measuring an amount of liquid a millilitre abbreviated as ml is the amount of liquid that would fill up a cube that measures centimetre on each side one l litre of liquid would fill up a cube that is cm on each side the unit of mass is the kilogram a kilogram kg weighs the same as a litre of water at normal temperature and pressure gram g is the weight of millilitre of water at degrees celsius the metric tonne is kilograms or a million grams british imperial units imperial units were defined in the united kingdom in these units sometimes based on similar units that were in use before imperial units were used in countries that were part of the british empire while many of these countries including the united kingdom have officially adopted si the older system of units are still used us customary units us customary units are the official units used in the us these are similar to the british imperial units and also based on the units used in the united kingdom from before american independence some of the units are different to the british ones for example there are imperial fluid ounces in an imperial pint but us fluid ounces in a us pint additionally the us fluid ounce is slightly bigger than the imperial fluid ounce the result is that us pints and gallons are smaller than imperial pints and gallons in the united states the metric system has been legal for trade since but other measurements such as the gallon inch and the pound are still widely used imperial and us units of measurement include length inch in foot ft yard yd and mile foot inches yard feet plural of foot inches mile yards feet

as the number of fluid ounces converting between systems metric to us meter yards inches liter fluid ounces pints us gallons kilogram ounces pounds us to metric length inch centimetres foot centimetres yard metres mile kilometres volume fluid ounce millilitres pint millilitres gallon litres cup ounces mass ounce grams pound kilograms other units of measure the unit of time is the second the minute seconds and hour minutes or seconds are larger units a day is usually said to be hours but is actually a little bit longer than that this difference is corrected at the end of some years with what is called a leap second a week days and month are also standard units a unit of measurement that applies to money is called a unit of account this is normally a currency issued by a country for instance the united states use dollars each dollar is cents the united kingdom uses pounds each pound is pennies or pence other countries in europe use the euro which is cent for the euro they are not called cents units for electricity magnetism and radiation were mostly invented in the th century when scientists learned how to measure them they are all part of the metric system because when this happened scientists saw no reason to invent other units notes u s customary units is the system of units of measurement used to measure things in the united states the system of imperial units is similar and in some parts identical length or distance units include the inch foot yard and mile land units include square miles square meter and acres square meter common volume units are the teaspoon tablespoon teaspoons fluid ounce two tablespoons cup ounces pint cups or fluid ounces quart pints or fluid ounces us gallon cups fluid ounces or liters a barrel is the unit to measure oil temperature is measured in degrees fahrenheit f here is a formula to convert from c to f units of weight include the pound grams which contains ounces this should not be confused with the british pound which is a type of money the different uses of the word pound can cause confusion different sizes of ounce are also in use some people have been trying to replace these units with the metric system since the s much infrastructure in the united states and british empire was built in past centuries using the old measures during the th century some sectors such as science medicine and the military of the united states converted to metric but americans still use the old units for daily purposes on the other hand world trade is conducted using the metric system and except for the u s the

is a gas giant it is the third largest planet in the solar system the planet is made of ice gases and liquid metal its atmosphere contains hydrogen h helium he and methane the temperature on uranus is degrees c k near the top of its atmosphere but its small solid core about the mass of earth is probably about k the planet is tilted on its axis so much that it is sideways it has five big moons many small ones and a small system of planetary rings the distance between uranus and the sun is about billion km uranus completes its orbit around the sun in earth years it completes a spin around itself in hours and minutes this means there are about uranian days in one uranian year uranus was discovered in this planet can be seen with the naked eye under perfect conditions john flamsteed saw it decades earlier but mistook it for a star tauri uranus is named after the greek god uranus who was a god of sky moons uranus has known moons they are named for characters from the works of shakespeare and alexander pope the five biggest moons are miranda ariel umbriel titania and oberon many moons have yet to be discovered exploring in nasa s voyager visited uranus this is the only space probe that tried to investigate the planet from a short distance clouds uranus is covered in blue clouds the top clouds made of methane are difficult to see lower clouds are thought to be frozen water there are also violent storms wind speeds can reach scientists are studying the clouds to try to understand the storms on the planet rings the scheme of uranus s ring moon system solid lines denote rings dashed lines denote orbits of moons the planet uranus has a system made of rings which is far fewer than the rings of saturn but more than those around jupiter and neptune the rings of uranus were discovered in more than years ago william herschel also reported observing rings but modern astronomers do not believe that he saw them because they are very dark and faint two additional rings were discovered in in images taken by voyager and two outer rings were found in by the hubble space telescope the rings are probably mainly composed of frozen water the rings of uranus are thought to be relatively young not more than million years old the uranian ring system probably began from the collisional fragmentation of moons that once existed around the planet after colliding the moons probably broke up into many particles which survived as narrow optically dense rings only in zones of maximum stability general properties uranus s inner rings the bright outer ring is the epsilon ring eight other rings are visible the ring system of uranus has thirteen distinct rings in order of increasing distance from the planet they are u r rings they can be divided into three groups nine narrow main rings two dusty rings u r and two outer rings the rings of uranus consist mainly of macroscopic particles and little dust although dust is known to be present in u r and rings in addition to these well known rings there may be numerous optically thin dust bands and faint rings between them these faint rings and dust bands may exist only temporarily some of them became visible during a series of ring plane crossing events in a number of dust bands between the rings were observed in forward scattering geometry by voyager all rings of uranus show azimuthal brightness variations the rings are made of an extremely dark material the rings are slightly red in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum and grey in near infrared they show no identifiable spectral features the chemical composition of the ring particles is not known however they cannot be made of pure water ice like the rings of saturn because they are too dark darker than the inner moons of uranus this shows that they are probably a mixture of the ice and a dark material the nature of this material is not clear but it may be organic compounds considerably darkened by the charged particle irradiation from the uranian magnetosphere the rings particles may consist of a heavily processed material which was initially similar to that of the inner moons a false colour near infrared image of uranus showing cloud bands rings and moons obtained by the hubble space telescope s nicmos camera as a whole the ring system of uranus is unlike either the faint dusty rings of jupiter or the broad and complex rings of saturn some of which are composed of very bright material water ice however there are similarities with some parts of the latter ring system the saturnian f ring and the ring are both narrow relatively dark and are shepherded by a pair of moons the newly discovered outer rings of uranus are similar to the outer g and e rings of saturn narrow ringlets existing in the broad saturnian rings also resemble the narrow rings of uranus in addition dust bands observed between the main rings of uranus may be similar to the rings of jupiter in contrast the neptunian ring system is quite similar to that of uranus although it is less complex darker and contains more dust the neptunian rings are also positioned further from the planet orbit and rotation uranus revolves around the sun once every earth years its average distance from the sun is roughly billion km about au the intensity of sunlight on uranus is about that on earth its orbital elements were first calculated in by pierre simon laplace with time discrepancies began to appear between the predicted and observed orbits and in john couch adams first proposed that the differences might be due to the gravitational tug of an unseen planet in urbain le verrier began his own independent research into uranus s orbit on september johann gottfried galle located a new planet later named neptune at nearly the position predicted by le verrier the rotational period of the interior of uranus is hours minutes clockwise retrograde as on all giant planets its upper atmosphere experiences very strong winds in the direction of rotation at some latitudes such as about two thirds of the way from the equator to the south pole visible features of the atmosphere move much faster making a full rotation in as little as hours related pages

degree people must do some research history old buildings of university of bologna founded in the universities were born in europe during the middle ages the first institution of this type was the university of bologna that later became a model for similar centers of education this term can often be used in other cultures to mean centers of higher education and higher thought although their creation was often well before the middle ages at first the universities had formed themselves according to the model of the professional groups and like almost everything in the middle ages they remained tied to the catholic church at the beginning they had worked to teach the so called seven liberal arts the trivium and the quadrivium trivium grammar logic and rhetoric quadrivium arithmetic and geometry astronomy and music that earliest division caused the present divisions between literary and scientific fields the world s oldest university is qarawiyyin university organization a university can include several campuses or different places where classes are taught in each campus there are several faculties and university schools mainly for teaching and also laboratories departments and institutes of research many campuses also have housing for students in buildings called dormitories and structures like libraries study rooms and gymnasiums for students that live there each school offers many courses that students take to earn a degree the person with the highest right to control and to command in a university is the rector who governs the university with the

most things with around words the most used words are short words that is true in all languages the most common words in english have fewer than seven letters half of these words have fewer than four

or a state it is the main part of a sentence every sentence has a verb in english verbs are the only kind of word that changes to show past or present tense every language in the world has verbs but they are not always used in the same ways they also can have different properties in different languages for example in some other languages e g chinese indonesian verbs do not change for past and present tense this means the definition above only works well for english verbs there are sixteen verbs used in basic english they are be do have come go see seem give take keep make put send say let get the word verb the word verb originally comes from were a proto indo european word meaning a word it comes to english through the latin verbum and the old french verbe verbal phrase in simple sentences the verb may be one word the cat sat on the mat however the verb may be a phrase the cat will sit on the mat verb forms in english and many other languages verbs change their form this is called inflection most english verbs have six inflected forms see the table but be has eight different forms forms of english verbs primary forms past walked she walked home rd singular present walks she walks home plain present walk they walk home secondary forms plain form walk she should walk home present participle walking she is walking home past participle walked she has walked home you should notice that some of the verb forms look the same you can say they have the same shape for example the plain present and the plain form of walk have the same shape the same is true for the past and the past participle but these different forms can have different shapes in other verbs for example the plain present of be is usually are but the plain form is be also the past of eat is ate but the past participle is eaten when you look for a verb in the dictionary it is usually the plain form that you look for an english sentence must have at least one primary form verb each main clause can only have one primary form verb kinds of verbs english has two main kinds of verbs normal verbs called lexical verbs and auxiliary verbs the difference between them is mainly in where they can go in a sentence some verbs are in both groups but there are very few auxiliary verbs in english there are also two kinds of auxiliary verbs modal verbs and non modal verbs the table below shows most of the english auxiliaries and a small number of other verbs kinds of english verbs auxiliary verbs lexical verbs modal verbs can you play the piano i fell i will not be there i didn t fall shall we go i had breakfast yes you may i m playing soccer you must be joking must you make that noise non modal verbs have you seen him have you seen him i did see it i did see it he is sleeping he is sleeping there are several auxiliary verbs to do do does did to be am is are was were creates a progressive tense to have have has had creates a perfect tense the following verbs are modal auxiliaries can could may might must shall should auxiliary verbs also inflect for negation usually this is done by adding not or n t you should n t be here he is n t at home we have n t started yet use of the auxiliary do sometimes the verb do is used with other verbs it does not really change the meaning but it can be used to make a strong statement i do talk present i did go past it is also used in the negative when no other auxiliary verbs are used i don t talk present i didn t go past sometimes it comes before the subject this is called inversion and it usually means the sentence is a question do you talk present did you go past many other languages do not use the verb do as an auxiliary verb they use the simple present for do and the simple past or perfect for did tense aspect and mood many people think that all different ways of using verbs are all different tenses this is not true there are three main systems related to the verb tense aspect and mood tense tense is mainly used to say when the verb happens in the past present or future in order to explain and understand tense it is useful to imagine time as a line on which past tense present tense and future tense are positioned some languages have all three tenses some have only two and some have no tenses at all english and japanese for example have only two tenses past and present chinese and indonesian verbs do not show tense instead they use other words in the sentence to show when the verb happens english tenses past tense present tense she walked home she walks home he ran quickly he runs quickly i could swim well i can swim well did you live here do you live here aspect aspect usually shows us things like whether the action is finished or not or if something happens regularly english has two aspects progressive and perfect in english aspect is usually shown by using participle verb forms aspect can combine with present or past tense progressive aspect english uses the gerund participle usually together with the auxiliary be and its forms am is are was and were to show the progressive aspect i m sleeping present progressive he was studying english last night past progressive he will be going to the store tomorrow future progressive many other languages such as french do not use progressive tenses i ve seen him twice present perfect i had lived there for three years past perfect the past perfect can be used to express an unrealized hope wish etc he had intended to bake a cake but ran out of flour she had wanted to buy him a gift but he refused after if wish and would rather the past perfect can be used to talk about past events that never happened if only i had been born standing up i wish you had told me that before i would rather you had gone somewhere else mood finally english mood is now usually shown by using modal verbs in the past english had a full mood system but that has almost completely disappeared the subjunctive mood now uses the plain form there is also a form of be that is used in conditionals to show that something is not true e g if i were a bird i would fly to california sentence parts that go with verbs certain parts of a sentence naturally come before verbs or after them but these are not always the same for all verbs the main sentence parts are subject object complement and modifier subjects almost all english sentences have subjects but sentences that are orders called imperatives usually do not have any subjects a subject usually comes before a verb but it can also come after auxiliary verbs in the following examples the subject is underlined and the primary verb is in bold we need you the food was good the small boy with red hair is sleeping can you see the car come here no subject objects many verbs can be followed by an object these verbs are called transitive verbs in fact some verbs must have an object e g take but some verbs never take an object e g sleep verbs that do not take an object are called intransitive verbs some verbs can even have two objects they are called ditransitive verbs in the following examples the object is underlined and the primary verb is in bold i m sleeping no object i took the book from him i gave him the book objects i am happy no object i became a teacher complement no object i slept in my bed object complements some verbs can or must be followed by a complement these verbs are called linking verbs or copula in the following examples the complement is underlined and the verb is in bold he is good he is a boy she became sick she became a manager it looks nice modifiers verbs can be modified by various modifiers mainly adverbs note that verbs generally do not need modifiers it s usually a choice in the following examples the adverb is underlined and the verb is in bold the boy ran quickly the freely swinging rope hit him verbs also commonly take a variety of other modifiers including prepositions differences between verbs and other words sometimes a verb and another word can have the same shape in these cases you can usually see the difference by looking at various properties of the words verbs vs adjectives sometimes a verb and an adjective can have the same shape usually this happens with participles for example the present participle interesting and the adjective interesting look the same verbs are different from adjectives though because they cannot be modified by very more or most for example you can say that is very interesting so you know interesting is an adjective here but you cannot say my teacher is very interesting me in math because in this sentence interesting is a verb on the other hand if you cannot change the be verb to seem or become it is probably a verb he was isolated he became isolated isolated is an adjective the door was opening the door became opening opening is a verb verbs vs nouns the gerund particle sometimes looks like a noun this is especially true when it is used as a subject as in the following example running is good for you the main differences between these verbs and nouns are modifiers number and object complement modifiers verbs cannot generally be modified by adjectives and nouns cannot generally be modified by adverbs so in running regularly is good for you running is a verb because it is modified by regularly an adverb number verbs cannot change for number so if you can make the word plural it is a noun not a verb for example this drawing is nice can change to these drawings are nice so drawing is a noun but drawing trees is fun cannot change to drawings trees is fun so it is a verb here object complement many verbs can take objects or complements but nouns cannot so in parking the car is hard parking is a verb because it takes the object the car but if you say there s no parking parking may be a noun because it does not have an object verbs vs prepositions some verbs have become prepositions again usually these share a shape with participles here are some examples given the problems i do not think we should go we have many helpers including john according to the map we are here he went to hospital following the fight the main difference between verbs and prepositions is that verbs have a subject even if the subject is not written you can understand what it is prepositions do not have a subject references this article is about physical object for meaning from audio field see loudness the volume of an object is a measure of the amount of space occupied by that object not to be confused with mass the volume of a mountain is much larger than the volume of a rock for instance the word volume implies a three dimensional context where by convention the length is the longest distance between the object s extremities the width or breadth refers to the size of the object in a direction perpendicular to its length the height or depth stands for the size of that object in the direction perpendicular to both the length and the width for objects at or near the earth s surface height or depth often refers to the dimension of the object along the local vertical all physical objects occupy a volume even if some are so thin that they appear to be two dimensional like a sheet of paper units of volume the unit of volume in the international system of units is the cubic meter which is represented by the symbol m in some fields or applications it is convenient to use different units to simplify the discussions or writings for instance everyday quantities of liquids are often measured in units of a litre symbol l which is the volume occupied by a cubic decimetre large quantities of liquids such as oil and sometimes other materials may be measured and traded in units of barrels there are many different reference volumes called barrels depending on the nature of the content traditional units are still in encountered in some countries imperial units such as the gallon or the fluid ounce were in widespread use within the british empire some of them are still popular in the united states which also uses units like the bushel or the quart the cup and the teaspoon in cooking recipes for example see u s customary units for more examples non conservation of volume the volume of an object is not a fundamental property of that object it can change with environmental conditions such as pressure and temperature especially if the object is highly compressible the volume of a mixture of fluids liquids gases may or may not be equal to the sum of their volumes before they were mixed measuring a volume the volume of simple geometric objects can often be calculated on the basis of their known dimensions the volume of a perfect cube of side c is c the volume of a parallelepiped of sides a b and c is a b c the volume of a sphere of radius r is r the volume of a gas is typically that of its container but it could be ill defined as in the case of the atmosphere which has no clear upper limit the volume of a liquid is often measured by pouring it into a graduated container the volume of a small solid can be estimated by immersing it into a graduated container partially filled with a known amount of liquid provided the solid is not soluble in the liquid related pages geometry venus is the second planet from the sun it has a day longer than a year the year length of venus is earth days the day length of venus is earth days it is a terrestrial planet because it has a solid rocky surface like other planets in the inner solar system astronomers have known venus for thousands of years the ancient romans named it after their goddess venus venus is the brightest thing in the night sky except for the moon it is sometimes called the morning star or the evening star as at some elongations it is easily seen just before the sun comes up in the morning and at other elongations just after the sun goes down in the evening venus comes closer to the earth than any other planet does venus is sometimes called the sister planet of earth as they are quite similar in size and gravity in other ways the planets are very different venus atmosphere air is mostly carbon dioxide with clouds of sulphuric acid sulphuric acid is a chemical that is very poisonous to humans the thick atmosphere has made it hard to see the surface and until the twenty first century many people thought things might live there the pressure on venus surface is times that of earth venus has no moons venus spins very slowly on its axis and it spins in the opposite direction to the other planets physical properties radar view of the surface of venus magellan spacecraft venus is a terrestrial planet so like the earth its surface is made of rock venus is much hotter than earth all the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere acts like a blanket trapping heat from the sun this effect is called the greenhouse effect and it is very strong on venus this makes the surface of venus the hottest of any planet s surface in the solar system with an estimated average temperature of this is hot enough to melt lead or zinc geography venus has no oceans because it is much too hot for water venus surface is a dry desert because of the clouds only radar can map the surface it is about smooth rocky plains made mostly of basalt two higher areas called continents make up the north and south of the planet the north is called ishtar terra and the south is called aphrodite terra they are named after the babylonian and greek goddesses of love atmosphere venus atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas with clouds of sulphuric acid because the atmosphere is so thick or dense the pressure is very high the pressure is times the pressure on earth enough to crush many things it is impossible to see the planet s surface from space as the thick cloud layer reflects of the light that hits it the only way scientists are able to see it is by using infrared and ultraviolet cameras and radar transit of venus venus can sometimes be seen passing

an independent sovereign state and the smallest country in the world by size at km its territory is completely surrounded by italy and it is only one of three countries in the world that are enclaves of another country the others being san marino also in italy and lesotho in southern africa also it is the only country in the world that is an enclave of a city as all of the land around it is part of rome the capital of italy the vatican city is the headquarters of the roman catholic church and its government the holy see its head of state is the pope which is religiously speaking the bishop of rome and head of the roman catholic church the current pope pope francis former cardinal jorge mario bergoglio was elected on march established on february with the lateran agreement patti lateranensi signed by benito mussolini and pope pius xi the vatican city is also important for its culture and art the vatican s masterpieces are very well known in the world st peter s square st peter s basilica the sistine chapel the vatican museums and the apostolic palace where the pope lives there are also hundreds of other sculptures and pictures history the pope used to rule the papal states which included most of italy catholic popes had generally tried to stop italy from becoming one country because they feared they would lose their control of at least one of the papal states in italy was unified under the king of savoy but rome and latium remained unconquered on september italian troops invaded rome became capital of the new kingdom the pope claimed he was a prisoner of the italian state and excommunicated all the people who helped invade the papal state this stopped catholics from taking part in public life under catholic government in benito mussolini decided to sign an agreement with the holy see called the lateran treaty which created the vatican state another treaty gave the vatican money each year to compensate for the lost territories politics and government the government structure is theocracy with the pontifical leader being the highest authority the pope is elected by the college of cardinals which can lead the roman catholic church and the city state

and direction if an object moves east at metres per second m s then its velocity is m s to the east the idea behind this is that speed doesn t tell us in which direction the object moves in a given frame of reference speed is one part of velocity direction is the other part depending on the frame of reference the velocity can be defined with many mathematical concepts required for making the correct analysis velocity in one dimensional motion average velocity to calculate the average velocity of an object we divide its displacement its change of position by the time it took to change position for example if an object moves meters m to the left in seconds s its velocity v would be equal to instantaneous velocity in contrast to average velocity the instantaneous velocity tells us how fast a given object is moving at a given instance of time velocity in two dimensional motion the concept of velocity allows us to consider two different means of calculating the velocity two dimensional motion requires us to use vector notation to define the physical quantities found throughout the kinematics distinction between average velocity and instantaneous velocity regarding two dimensional motion average velocity to calculate the average velocity of an object we divide its displacement its change of position by the time it took to change position where is the total distance traveled in a given time interval each of these quantities can be calculated by substracting two different values intertwined within the given quantity hence give the desired instantaneous velocity contrary to average velocity the instantaneous velocity tells us the rate of change at which a given object is moving along a certain path at a given instance of time which usually tends to be infinitesimally small when we can see that taking that into consideration we can conceptualize this rate of change between displacement vector and interval of time using mathematical analysis most notably calculus references a virtual community is a group of people who share an interest hobby or set of views the people in it may come from many different places they talk with each other using

or edited by anyone who has an account on the wiki or by everyone in the world if the wiki allows it some important pages can only be changed by certain users wikis are central places where we all can share information people can add new information and then people read them wikis allow information from all around the world to be collected on a wiki people can write pages by collaboration pages are watched closely to see whether changes are good or bad if one person writes something wrong another can correct it other users can also add something new to the page because of this the page gets better when people change it administrators can block someone from editing if they vandalize or for other reasons users can also discuss things on wikis discussion can help people understand things better and get a chance to tell their views in wikipedia the talk pages are for that but in some wikis the article and the discussion are in the same page wikis can be used for different things not all wikis follow the same rules for using them for example the purpose of wikipedia is to write articles for an encyclopedia that is why in wikipedia people do not want general discussion that does not help in writing articles ward cunningham started the first wiki in march many people liked it and wrote there after which they started similar websites mediawiki is the most used software for wikis jspwiki is one of many others wiki is also sometimes an abbreviation for wikipedia vandalism a wiki is freely editable by anyone some wikis are even available to people without an account so wikis are targets for vandals to add misleading or unwelcome content to there are many ways to prevent this individual pages can be protected to allow only certain users or only those with an account to edit them administrators can also block users who make much trouble vandalism may not be stopped totally but regular careful checking can diminish the amount other websites wikis in plain english

sometimes including the computer inside mobile telephones and televisions the websites are kept on computers called web servers there is almost always a single homepage which has links to other pages that are part of that site sometimes it has links to pages that are part of other sites as well note that net jargon uses the word site which also means a physical place in the real world to mean a web url a home page serves as the introduction page of a website websites can be used to advertise or sell things they can also be used to talk to other people a blog is a website where the location of the material is less relevant than who writes it and which is more focused on dialogue very often the people who use blogs dislike the word site since it implies a controlled place sites are good for looking up information on the computer types of websites weblog or also known as blog wiki a website where anyone can edit the pages content management system software that can edit web pages through a wysiwyg editor search engine a website like google which you can use to search the web social networking sites like facebook which allows you to interact with friends access users can access any website by using a url this is the website address which is shown near the top of the web browser the homepage and the rest of the site usually have the same words at the start of the url for instance pages at the simple english wikipedia always start http simple wikipedia org but are different after that however if a person does not buy a domain name the website could be an ip address

a word is something spoken by the mouth that can be pronounced in alphabetic writing it is a collection of letters used together to communicate a meaning these can also usually be pronounced a logogram is also a word some words have more than one meaning for example spring can refer to the season the device or a conjugation of the verb these are homonyms some words have different pronunciation for example wind the noun and wind the verb are pronounced differently some words have different spelling for example color and colour which are both correct color is used in american english and colour is used in british english some words can be only one letter for example a and i in english besides english other languages have their own words when written with an alphabet words are usually separated by a space when written with ideograms each word is usually a separate symbol words can be invented this is called neologism for example radar was originally an acronym but became an actual word two words may be joined to make a compound word fuller definition a word is the smallest thing which can be said with meaning for example hello is a word this contrasts with a morpheme which is the smallest unit of meaning but may not stand on its own a word may consist of a single morpheme for example oh rock red quick run expect or several rocks redness quickly running unexpected whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on its own as a word in the words just given these are s ness ly ing un ed the meaning of a word can be found in a dictionary related pages

is an alcoholic drink the word wine is usually used to talk about drinks made from the juice of grapes although people sometimes call alcoholic drinks made from the juice of other fruits such as plums or blackberries wine this article only deals with wine made from grapes wine is made by the fermentation of the sugar in grapes there are two main types of wine red wine and white wine red wine is made from red grapes in contact with their skins and white wine is made from red and white grapes but without any skin contact ros wine is made by leaving red grapes in skin contact for a very short time the colour comes only from the skin so if you have short skin contact the wine will not turn red but only pink rose wine wine sometimes has bubbles in it this wine is called sparkling wine the most popular sparkling wines are champagne which comes from france and spumante from italy people have been making wine for about years wine is a popular drink in many countries the countries that drink the most wine using numbers from the year are france italy usa germany spain argentina united kingdom china russia romania lebanon however if you make a list of countries where the average person drinks the most wine the list is different luxembourg france italy portugal croatia switzerland spain argentina uruguay and slovenia wine is made in many countries the countries that make the

calling water by the unfamiliar chemical name dihydrogen monoxide dhmo and listing some of its harmful effects in an alarming way some examples include talking about how it causes burning suffocation and corrosion when it s actually just talking about hot water drowning and rust sometimes the parody calls for it to be banned and or labelled as dangerous the prank works because it takes advantage of people s misunderstanding calling water by an unfamiliar name and making it sound like a harmful chemical can make people think it s dangerous if they don t know that you re just talking about water dihydrogen monoxide is an alternative chemical name for water but nobody uses it the word dihydrogen means two hydrogens and monoxide means one oxygen water s chemical formula has two hydrogens and one oxygen the parody gained most of its popularity in the s when a year old named nathan zohner collected anti dhmo petitions for a science project about gullibility zohner fooled a lot of people which has led to his project being used in lessons about critical thinking and the scientific method the website dhmo org is a joke website which lists the harmful effects of water dhmo answers

discovery of a gigantic cloud of water vapor containing trillion times more water than all of earth s oceans combined around a quasar located billion light years from earth according to the researchers the discovery shows that water has been prevalent in the universe for nearly its entire existence water has been detected in interstellar clouds in our galaxy the milky way water probably

want is a wish or a desire for something if a person would like to have something but can choose not to have it that thing is wanted or can be called a want to want is not the same as to need which is when someone must have something people often talk about needing a thing when they really just want it wants can be for the same things as needs for example a person can need to eat food and can want to eat cake if there is no cake then he or she may have to eat something else perhaps bread the need is no longer so important the person is no longer hungry although the want may still be there if there is cake then the person s needs and wants can both be met in economics a want is about goods or services choice is how to satisfy a want when there are different ways to do this want can also be the idea of what it means to be poor hungry or with no money charles dickens wrote a famous book called a christmas carol in which there are two children named want and ignorance painting of pier gerlofs donia and wijerd jelckama fighting for the freedom of his people war is a situation or a period of fighting between countries or groups of people a war generally involves the use of weapons a military organization and soldiers war is a situation in which a nation enforces its rights by using force not every armed conflict is a war a fight between individuals between gangs drug cartels etc is not considered a war however most wars are called armed conflicts international humanitarian law is a set of rules that tries to limit the effects of wars international humanitarian law recognizes two kinds of wars these are international armed conflicts between two or more states non international armed conflicts as being between a government and a group that is not a government or one that is between two such groups karl von clausewitz wrote in his classic book on war that war is a mere continuation of policy with other means clausewitz viewed war as a political instrument his book about military philosophy remains the most influential work on the history and strategy of war an earlier authority on war was sun tzu in his book the art of war sun tzu saw war as a necessary evil it was something people do wars have been fought to control natural resources for religious or cultural reasons and over political balances of power they have been fought over legitimacy correctness of particular laws they have been fought to settle arguments about land or money and many other issues the reasons behind any war are often very complex while a war can start for just about any reason there is usually more than one cause war and the beginning of nations from the earliest times individual states or political factions have used war to gain sovereignty over regions in one of the earliest civilizations in history mesopotamia they were in a near constant state of war ancient egypt during its early dynastic period came about by war when lower and upper egypt were joined together as one country about bc the zhou dynasty ruled ancient china came to power in through war scipio africanus bce defeated carthage leading ancient rome to begin a conquest of the known world philip ii of macedon bce united a group of city states to become ancient greece kinds of war sometimes people don t see a difference between fighting between countries or people and the formal declaration of a state of war those who do see this difference usually only use the word war for the fighting where the countries governments have officially declared war on each other smaller armed conflicts are often called riots rebellions coups etc one country may send forces to another country for a variety of reasons sometimes it is to help keep order or prevent killings of innocents or other crimes against humanity it may be to protect a friendly government against an uprising here it may be called a police action or humanitarian intervention instead of a war some people think it s still a war another kind of war existed from until called the cold war this started when diplomatic relations between the united states and the soviet union broke down both countries had nuclear weapons and both stood ready to use them against the other but there was no actual war between the two it ended with the fall of the soviet union in the cold war was also called a containment where the united states tried to prevent the spread of communism to other countries during the cold war the major powers did not fight themselves but often backed third parties in what was called a proxy war the vietnam war is often given as an example of a proxy war but proxy wars happened long before the cold war and are still happening a war between peoples and groups in the same country is known as a civil war it is generally agreed there are two things that make a war a civil war it must be a struggle between groups in the same country or state over political control or to force a major change in the government s policy the second criterion is that more than people have to have been killed with a minimum of from each side the american civil war is an example of a civil war while the figures are mere estimates the total casualties are thought to be about laws of war only in the last years or so have states agreed on international laws to limit warfare this has been mainly for humanitarian reasons the geneva conventions and the hague conventions are two examples of agreements that establish laws governing wars collectively these are usually called international humanitarian law ihl because these are established laws they restrict those engaged in armed conflicts to follow the ihl also a country must not only respect the law but they also need to make sure other countries respect it as well they cannot turn a blind eye meaning pretend they do not see a thing to countries who are not following ihc the first of these was the geneva convention in it became international law with the signatures of countries statistical analysis the statistical analysis of war was started by lewis fry richardson following world war i more recent databases of wars have been assembled by the

year starts on january and ends on december in the gregorian calendar but a fiscal year or a school year can start on a different day of the year there are several ways used to measure the length of a year a solar year is based on the seasons the gregorian calendar is based on the solar year the solar year is days long a tropical year is a solar year as measured between two vernal equinoxes sometimes called the first day of spring a lunar year is based on the moon and is usually lunar months days hours minutes each or days long a sidereal year measures the time between when a selected fixed star is highest in the night sky an anomalistic year is the difference between the times when the earth gets closest to the sun an eclipse year is the time between node passages this is when the sun moves through a part of the sky where it is possible for the sun earth and moon to be in a line it is also when eclipses can happen solar and lunar years are used by different calendars for daily life the other measurements are used by astronomers there was no year numbered year zero in a normal system of counting because it would mean there is a year earlier than the first year which was the year ad one in the anno domini system also called ce in the common era used with our gregorian calendar however some astronomers call the year bc or bce year to make it easier for them to count leap

group of languages used by chinese people in china and elsewhere it forms part of a language family called the sino tibetan family of languages chinese includes many regional language varieties the main ones being mandarin wu yue and min these are not mutually intelligible and many of the regional varieties are themselves a number of non mutually intelligible subvarieties as a result many linguists refer to these varieties as separate languages chinese can refer to the written or the spoken languages although there are many spoken chinese languages they use the same writing system differences in speaking are reflected in differences in writing official china adopts a similar policy to the one in the soviet union using one standard language in english we call the standard chinese language mandarin in mainland china they call it ptnghu or common to everybody speech in taiwan they call it guy or language of the whole country all official documents are written in mandarin and mandarin is taught all over china it is also a standard for language teaching in some other countries a standard language lets people in the same country understand each other chinese is used by the han people in china and other ethnic groups in china who are declared chinese by the chinese government chinese is almost always written in chinese characters they are symbols that have meaning called logograms they also give some indication of pronunciation but the same character can get very different pronunciations among the different kinds of chinese since chinese characters have been around for at least years people in places far from each other say them differently just as can be read differently in different languages chinese people needed to write down pronunciations in dictionaries chinese does not have an alphabet so how to write down sounds was a big problem in the beginning nowadays the mandarin language uses hanyu pinyin to represent the sounds in roman letters all the chinese languages or dialects use tones this means that they use high and low pitches to help make differences in meaning clear different languages or dialects of chinese the chinese language is like a big tree the base of the tree started thousands of years ago it now has several main limbs some people call just a branch what other people call a main limb so you can say there are six or seven main limbs each of these main limbs splits off into branches about the way there are branches of english spoken in great britain the united states australia india and so forth just as the

still use the more traditional characters the korean language also uses chinese characters to represent certain words the japanese language uses them even more often these characters are known in korean as hanja and in japanese as kanji a chinese person with a good education today knows characters about chinese characters are needed to read a mainland newspaper however people who have learned only the most frequently used characters can read a newspaper but they will have to guess some less used words examples spoken mandarin chinese here are some samples of some words and sentences in mandarin chinese simplified characters are on the left and traditional characters are on the right the pronunciation is given in the pinyin system which may not always be as simple as it looks for those who have not studied it the traditional characters are now used in hong kong and taiwan chinese from mainland china uses the simplified characters but may recognize traditional characters before chinese was written using only traditional characters at that time most chinese people could not read or write at all the government of the people s republic of china thought that the traditional characters were very hard to understand they also thought that if they made the characters simpler more people could learn how to read and write today many people in china can read and write with the

zero hats that means he does not have a hat symbol the symbol for the number zero is arithmetic with zero adding a number to zero results in that number for example adding zero to three gives three in symbols subtracting zero from a number always gives that number for example subtracting zero from three gives three in symbols subtracting a positive number from zero always makes that number negative or if a negative number is subtracted from zero it makes the number positive in symbols multiplying a number by zero always gives zero for example multiplying forty three by zero gives zero in symbols number dividing zero by a number always gives zero for example dividing zero by forty three gives zero in symbols any number divided by zero has no answer in symbols has an undefined answer zero divided by zero has no answer in symbols has no answer below are all of the above examples with a few others in a condensed and generalized form in a tabular layout here in the table below x represents any number operation rule example addition x x subtraction x x multiplication x division x when x x is undefined is undefined exponentiation x x root logarithm log b is undefined factorial sine sin cosine cos tangent tan derivative integral d x c history of zero the idea of zero was first thought about in babylon india and in central america at different times some places and countries did not know about a zero which may have made it harder for those people to do mathematics for example the year after bc is year there is no year in india zero was discovered in the th century by mathematician brhamgupta over hundreds of years the idea of zero was passed from country to country from india and babylon to other places like greece persia and the arab world the europeans learned about zero from the arabs and stopped using roman math this is why numbers are called arabic numerals the place of zero as a number zero is almost never used as a place number ordinal number this means that it is not used like or to indicate the order or place of something like st nd or rd an exception to this is seen in many programming languages some other things about zero the number zero is a whole number the number zero is not a positive number the number zero is not a negative number either the number zero is a neutral number any number divided by itself equals one except if that number is zero in symbols not a number in time zero means now for example when a person is counting down the time to the start of something such as a foot race or when a rocket takes off the count is three two one zero or go zero is the exact time of the start of the race or when the rocket takes off into the sky as a number is the integer that precedes the positive and follows in most if not all numerical systems was identified before the idea of negative integers was accepted it means courageous one in hieroglyphics zero is a number which means an amount of null size that is if the number of your brothers is zero that means the same thing as having no brothers and if something has a weight of zero it has no weight if the difference between the numbers of pieces in two piles is zero it means the two piles have an equal number of pieces before counting starts the result can be assumed to be zero that is the number of items counted before you count the first item and counting the first item brings the result to one and if there are no items to be counted zero remains the final result while mathematicians all accept zero as a number some non mathematicians would say that zero is not a number arguing that one cannot have zero of something others say that if one has a bank balance of zero one has a specific quantity of money in that account namely none it is that latter view which is accepted by mathematicians and most others normally speaking there was no year zero between bc and ad more exactly almost all historians leave out the year zero from the proleptic gregorian and julian calendars that is from the normal calendar used in english speaking countries but astronomers include it in these same calendars however the phrase year zero may be used to describe any event considered so important that someone might want to start counting years all over again from zero as a numeral right the modern numeral is normally written as a circle or rounded rectangle in old style fonts with text figures is usually the same height as a lowercase x unusual appearance of the digit zero on seven segment displays usual appearance of the digit zero on seven segment displays on the seven segment displays of calculators watches etc is usually written with six line segments though on some historical calculator models it was written with four line segments the four segment is not common the number zero as in the zero brothers example above is not the same as the numeral or digit zero used in numeral systems using positional notation successive positions of digits have higher values so the digit zero is used to skip a position and give appropriate value to the preceding and following digits a zero digit is not always necessary in a different positional number system something called bijective numeration is a possible example of a system without zeroes the numerical digit zero zero is also used as a numerical digit used to represent that number in numerals it is used to hold the place of that digit because correct placing of digits affects a numeral s value examples in the numeral which stands for one times ten and zero units or ones in the numeral which stands for one times a hundred plus zero tens plus zero units telling zero and the letter o apart a comparison of the letter o and the number the number and the letter o are both round so what is the difference the difference is important on a computer for one thing a computer will not do arithmetic with the letter o because it does not know that it should have been a zero the oval shaped zero and circular letter o came into use together on modern character displays the zero with a dot in the centre seems to have begun as a choice on ibm controllers this has the problem that it looks like the greek letter theta the slashed zero looking like the letter o with a diagonal line drawn inside it is used in old style ascii graphic sets that came from the default typewheel on the well known asr teletype this format causes problems because it looks like the symbol representing the empty set as well as for certain scandinavian languages which use as a letter the rule which has the letter o with a slash and the zero without was used at ibm and a few other early mainframe makers this is even more of a problem for scandinavians because it looks like two of their letters at the same time some burroughs unisys computers display a zero with a backwards slash and yet another convention common on early line printers left zero without any extra dots or slashes but added a tail or hook to the letter o so that it resembled an inverted q or cursive capital letter o a german licence plate showing zeroes the letters used on some european number plates for cars make the two symbols look different this is done by making the zero rather egg shaped and the o more circular but most of all by cutting open the zero on the upper right side so the circle is not closed any more as in german plates the style of letters chosen is called flschungserschwerende schrift abbr fe schrift meaning script which is harder to falsify but those used in the united kingdom do not make the letter o and the number look different from each other because there can never be any mistake if the letters are correctly spaced in paper writing you do not have to make the and o look different at all or you may add a slash across the zero in order to show the difference although this sometimes causes mistakes in the number zeroes of a function functions are explained in the function mathematics article if the function f x then x is called a zero of the function f for example if the function f x is x then the zeroes of the function are and because f and f zeroes of a function are used because they are another way to talk about solving an equation which is a main goal in algebra if we want to solve an equation like x then we can subtract the right hand side of the equation from both sides in this case whatever we get on the left hand side in this case x can be called a function f x the right hand side has to be zero because we subtracted it from itself so f x finding the zeroes of this function is the same as solving this equation in the paragraph before the zeroes of this function are and so they are the solutions of this equation we got this equation by subtracting the same thing from both sides so we also have solutions to the equation we started with in this case x so if we could find zeroes of functions we could solve any equation related pages number theory division by

is sometimes considered a post transition metal its symbol on the periodic table is zn zinc is the th element on the periodic table and has an atomic number of zinc has a mass number of it contains protons and electrons in total isotopes of zinc are known and five of these occur in nature some isotopes are radioactive their half lives are between milliseconds for zn and x years for zn zinc is a metal that is mostly used for galvanizing and batteries it is the fourth most common metal properties physical properties zinc is a shiny bluish grey metal when it has just been cut zinc has a whitish grey color if it is exposed to air it will not stay shiny for long its melting point is at boiling point is cooling point is at and freezing point is at this temperature is lower than most transition metals but higher than tin or lead it can be melted on a cooking stove it boils at a low temperature for a metal it is not magnetic when heated a little it becomes very flexible if it is heated more it becomes very brittle it forms alloys easily with other metals chemical properties zinc is a reactive metal it is about as reactive as aluminium and more reactive than most of the more common metals such as iron copper nickel and chrome it is less reactive than magnesium zinc can react with acids bases and nonmetals it does not rust in air though a coating of zinc oxide and zinc carbonate forms on the surface of the zinc when it is in air this coating stops corrosion acids can dissolve this coating and react with the zinc metal this reaction of zinc with an acid makes a zinc ii salt such as zinc chloride and hydrogen gas this is a very common chemical reaction the reaction below is the reaction with hydrochloric acid zn hcl zncl h zinc burning zinc can burn when powdered or in small pieces to make zinc oxide a white powder the flame is bright blue green zn o zno zinc oxide can dissolve in strong bases this reaction happens in some batteries that have zinc in them zno h o oh zn oh zinc is a chalcophile this means that it would rather react with sulfur and elements below it on the periodic table than oxygen that is why zinc sulfide is the most common zinc ore not zinc oxide chemical compounds zinc can make chemical compounds with other elements these chemical compounds are only in one oxidation state a compound has been found but it is hard to make there are no other oxidation states other than or most of these compounds have no color if they have a color it is not the zinc that is making the color zinc chloride is one of the most common zinc compounds they are quite unreactive they are a little acidic when dissolved in water they make a green flame when heated in a fire other zinc compounds are zinc antimonide gray semiconductor zinc arsenide orange

concentrated by flotation there is a detergent that collects the zinc sulfide the impurities sink to the bottom and are removed then the zinc sulfide is heated in air to make zinc oxide and sulfur dioxide zns o zno so the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfur trioxide so o so the sulfur trioxide reacts with the zinc oxide to make zinc sulfate this makes a soluble form of zinc which can be processed more so zno znso the zinc sulfate is purified and electrolyzed this electrolysis makes oxygen zinc and sulfuric acid this makes a pure zinc that is known as shg or special high grade znso h o zn h so o the sulfuric acid is reused in place of the sulfur trioxide to leach more zinc oxide zinc oxide can also be reduced by carbon to zinc metal and carbon dioxide at high temperatures this is a blast furnace process similar to how iron is made zno c zn co this form of zinc is cheaper but is not pure zinc is the fourth most common metal in the world about million tons are made every year uses as a metal a hot dipped galvanized item common alkaline batteries these batteries have a bluish gray zinc powder in the middle of the battery zinc is used in electrical batteries the alkaline cell and the leclanche cell are the ones that use zinc the most it becomes oxidized and provides electrons for the battery to run about of zinc is used for corrosion prevention which includes galvanizing of the world s zinc is used for galvanizing this is used to protect another metal usually iron from rusting the zinc coating corrodes instead of the iron the zinc coating can be placed on the metal in two ways the metal can be dipped into a pot of melted zinc the zinc can also be electroplated on to the metal dipping lasts longer but has a patchy surface that some do not think looks nice it is also used in motorboats and pipelines to slow rusting the motor of a motorboat often has a bullet of zinc that will corrode easily but will help other metal parts of the motor to stay rust free zinc is used in alloys brass is an alloy of copper and zinc brass is the most common zinc alloy zinc can form alloys with many other metals zinc aluminium is an alloy of zinc and aluminium which makes good bearings commercial bronze has zinc in it sometimes cadmium telluride is reacted with zinc to make cadmium zinc telluride a semiconductor nickel silver is another zinc alloy zinc can be used in the pipes of a pipe organ an alloy of tin and lead was used in the past zinc is used in the us penny where it only has a thin layer of copper the core is zinc older pennies were made completely out of bronze a mixture of powdered zinc and sulfur can be used to propel a model rocket this reaction makes zinc sulfide heat light and gases zinc sheet metal is used to make zinc bars as zinc compounds about of zinc is used to make zinc compounds zinc oxide can be used for sunscreen or paint pigment zinc oxide also is a semiconductor zinc chloride is used to preserve wood so it does not rot some fungicides have zinc in them zinc sulfate is used in dyes and pigments zinc sulfide is used in fluorescent bulbs to convert the ultraviolet light to visible light in biology humans need a little bit of zinc to help their body run well if they do not get enough zinc in their food they can get a mineral deficiency almost two billion people have a zinc deficiency zinc deficiency makes one more easily get infections some people say that when we get colds we should take more zinc others say that zinc does not make a difference there are medicines that one can use when they have a cold people add tiny amounts of zinc compounds to vitamin pills and cereals to make sure that they get enough zinc most single tablet vitamins have zinc in them zinc is found in at least enzymes it is the second most common transition metal other than iron zinc also is used by the brain the human body contains to grams of zinc a zinc enzyme helps remove carbon dioxide from blood wheat has much zinc in it safety large amounts of zinc metal are toxic it can dissolve in stomach acid when too much zinc is eaten copper and iron levels go down in the body zinc compounds can be corrosive in the stomach zinc compounds put in the nose can ruin the sense of smell zinc ions are very toxic to fish and many things that live in water references zebra s are mammals of the family equidae zebras are african

or zoo is a place where many different species types of animals are kept so people can see and watch them modern zoos try not only to be for people s entertainment but for education research and the conservation and protection of animals many zoos are centers where rare animals are preserved when they are in danger of dying out these modern zoos also want to give the animals a natural life so that they are healthy and behave normal this is done for the animals but also that people can see the animals as if they were in nature and not in a zoo zoos cost money they educate the public on the biological diversity that makes up the world they help people and wildlife successfully coexist they pursue continuing research and education for people they preserve crucial natural resources they work to ensure zoos can provide the most natural environment possible for wildlife in its care without enough money they cannot do these things many zoos are not like the modern type of zoo there the

symbol video explaining the history of copyright copyright is a law that gives the owner of a work like a book movie picture song or website the right to say how other people can use it copyright laws make it easier for authors to make money by selling their works it is one part of a group of laws about intellectual property the others being trademark and patent law with copyright a work can only be copied if the owner gives permission if someone copies a work without permission the owner can say they infringed their copyright when this happens the owner may sue for the amount that should have been paid most cases are handled by civil law in more serious cases a person who copies a work that is protected under copyright could be arrested fined or even go to prison history of copyright copyright was originally made for books before printing presses were made books could only be copied by hand which would take a while to do but when printing presses were made books could be copied faster and easier because of this some books were copied by people who did not own the book themselves so lawmakers gave owners the right to copy because technology got better over time copyright began to cover other things people could make like pictures sound and film who owns copyright in most countries authors automatically own the copyright to any work they make or create as long as they do not give the copyright to someone else in most countries there is no need to register the copyright and some countries do not even have procedures to register copyrights but where registration is available many authors register anyway especially for works that are sold for money that is because registration helps to prove that the copyright of a work belongs to a certain author if an author gets paid to make a work for someone else the person who pays for making the work for example the author s employer will often get to own the copyright instead of the author him herself for example if a person working for a company like microsoft creates a new computer software program at work the microsoft company would own the copyright length of copyright protection copyright laws usually protect owners of copyright beyond their lifetime in some countries such as canada and new zealand works are protected for years after the author dies in other countries like the united states and the united kingdom the protection lasts for years after death when the period of copyright protection has ended the written document musical composition book picture or other creative work is in the public domain this means that no one owns the copyright and everyone is free to copy use and change them without having to ask for permission or pay the owner fair use there is an exception to the rules of copyright called fair use this means that people can copy a very small amount of a work to use in reviews or in research reports an example of fair use is when newspaper writers quote several sentences from a copyright protected document to tell the story another example of fair use is when a university professor quotes several sentences from a copyright protected book in a review of the book or in a research report copyright in different countries different countries have different copyright laws most of the differences are about whether or not the government s work falls under copyright how much longer copyright lasts after the author dies or after the work is created or published and what is and what is not fair use because of these differences a certain piece of work may be under copyright in one country and in the public domain in another problems with copyright creativity some people argue that copyright laws make it easier for people to make new works and think of new ideas after all if authors get to make money for the time effort and money they put in then they will want to make more works later and make more money but others believe that copyright laws make it harder to be creative without copyright other people could reuse existing work and copyright law often stops that publisher control if an author wants to sell a work it s often easiest to give the copyright to a publisher the publisher will do all the selling and in return for that service will keep part of the money but the publisher has many different things to sell and they may not want to sell the work the author made authors often find it very hard to find a publisher willing to sell their work but without a publisher it can be even harder for an author to sell his or her work in many markets a few big publishers own the copyrights to almost everything available and stores will not want to sell works published by small authors themselves many people say copyright law helps big publishers stay in control and keeps smaller authors out of the market tragedy of the anticommons open content as a solution to these problems groups of authors have come up with the idea of open content with open content authors give everyone permission to copy change and give away or sell their works as long as they follow certain rules these rules are explained in an open content license some possible open content rules are if a person changes the work or if a person makes a new derivative work based on it they must give the original author credit they must say who wrote it if a person publishes the changed or derivative piece of work they must let others use it under the same free license under some licenses a person cannot sell the piece of work or use it to make money the

all of what is now called mongolia after the japanese were defeated by the allies during world war ii taiwan was controlled by the roc in the chinese communists fought a war against the nationalists and won they established the people s republic of china the nationalists left mainland china and arrived in taiwan politics after the roc created a base on taiwan it hoped one day to capture the mainland but chinese communists grew stronger so the nationalists never did go back the communists say they replaced the roc as the only government of china and also calls taiwan their own there are those people in taiwan who want to never be a part of the people s republic of china they believe in complete taiwan independence and want to rename the roc taiwan to republic of taiwan so taiwan can no longer have any ancestral connection to china or chinese culture some other people wish to unite with the people s republic of china they want chinese reunification some still want to attack the prc and reunify china under the republic of china some others want the status quo which means keeping everything the way it is now language most taiwanese people speak the standard chinese language known as mandarin and others speak local dialects such as min nan taiwanese or hakka the cantonese language spoken in parts of southern china for example the province of guangdong hong kong and macau is not spoken in taiwan a small percentage of aboriginal taiwanese speak aboriginal languages but the rest of the chinese people have treated them badly and many of these people and their languages struggle to survive some older taiwanese people who went to school while the country was under japanese rule can speak japanese after the nationalist government fled the mainland in they brought their language mandarin with them and made mandarin the only official language then everyone in the roc had to learn mandarin but unlike the people in mainland china the taiwanese never changed to simplified chinese characters and so they have always used traditional chinese characters in the past students were not allowed to speak their mother tongue in school and were expected to speak only mandarin taiwanese hakka and native languages were considered bad until the early s when education in these languages began to be taught in some school systems they were promoted but by this time many young people could speak only mandarin notes references simple english might mean basic english the simple english wikipedia which gives information about a certain subject using fewer words and

controversy prisons are a controversial topic that people have different views about people who think that we should have prisons say that removing people who commit crimes from society prevents them from committing more crimes and punishes them for their behavior they also say that putting people in prison may also prevent others who are likely to commit similar crimes from committing them people who think that we should not put people in prisons say that being put in prison makes people more violent and angry people who commit minor crimes that are sent to prison meet violent criminals as well when people are sent to prison they cannot see their family or children which can cause problems for their family sometimes people are put in prison who have done nothing wrong an american theory that is critical of prisons is called the prison industrial complex people who believe in the prison industrial complex think that private prison companies want lots of people to be put in prison in

sea of atlas geologic history the atlantic formed when the americas moved west from eurasia and africa this began sometime in the cretaceous period roughly million years ago it was part of the break up of the supercontinent pangaea the east coast of south america is shaped somewhat like the west coast of africa and this gave a clue that continents moved over long periods of time continental drift the atlantic ocean is still growing now because of sea floor spreading from the mid atlantic ridge while the pacific ocean is said to be shrinking because the sea floor is folding under itself or subducting into the mantle geography the atlantic ocean is bounded on the west by north and south america it connects to the arctic ocean through the denmark strait greenland sea norwegian sea and barents sea it connects with the mediterranean sea through the strait of gibraltar in the southeast the atlantic merges into the indian ocean the east meridian defines its border in the southwest the drake passage connects it to the pacific ocean the panama canal links the atlantic and pacific the atlantic ocean is second in size to the pacific it occupies an area of about the volume of the

where the ocean is deep gulf stream the atlantic ocean has important ocean currents one of these called the gulf stream flows across the north atlantic water gets heated by the sun in the caribbean sea and then moves northwest toward the north pole this makes france ireland britain iceland and norway in europe much warmer in winter than newfoundland and nova scotia in canada without the gulf stream the climates of northeast canada and northwest europe might be the same because these places are about the same distance from the north pole there are currents in the south atlantic too but the

symbol on the periodic table is hg and its atomic number is its atomic mass is the symbol hg stands for its latinized greek name hydrargyrum meaning watery or liquid silver history the planet mercury has been used for a very long time to represent the element no one has the credit for finding mercury it was known in ancient times mercury was found in egyptian tombs that are from bc chinese people also knew it from long ago in china and tibet people thought using mercury would make them live longer and have better health one of china s emperors qn sh hung d is said to have been buried in a tomb with rivers of flowing mercury he died from drinking a mixture of mercury and powdered jade because he wanted to live forever however this only made him die of liver failure poisoning and brain death the ancient greeks used mercury in ointments the egyptians and the romans used it in cosmetics these cosmetics sometimes hurt and made faces uglier properties physical properties mercury is a silvery white liquid post transition metal the reason for mercury being a liquid is complex it is heavy a chunk of iron can float on mercury compared to other metals it does not conduct heat well however it conducts electricity fairly well mercury is the only metal with a known melting point c lower than caesium mercury is one of the two elements that are liquids at standard temperature and pressure bromine is the other one mercury may be seen as a transition metal but it is normally seen as a post transition metal it is in group of the periodic table mercury has seven stable nonradioactive isotopes hg is the most common isotope mercury makes a blue to ultraviolet color in a tube when a spark is passed through it the ultraviolet light can kill germs or light fluorescent lamps chemical properties mercury is an unreactive metal it does not corrode in air unless hydrogen sulfide is also there similar to silver mercury can oxidize to mercury ii oxide when heated in air if it is heated further it decomposes into mercury and oxygen again it does not dissolve in ordinary acids but can dissolve in oxidizing acids to make mercury salts it can make amalgams when mixed with most metals like aluminium gold and zinc iron tantalum tungsten and platinum do not make amalgams with mercury iron flasks were used to trade mercury because of this mercury can dissolve large amounts of aluminium metal making it dangerous to transport in aluminium containers the thin layer of oxide on aluminium stops it from amalgamating making an amalgam with aluminium but the oxide coating can be damaged to expose the metal then the aluminium metal is dissolved and oxidizes to aluminium oxide the aluminium oxide forms a solid and releases the mercury which amalgamates more aluminium this process keeps repeating until a large amount of aluminium is dissolved chemical compounds mercury ii fulminate mercury forms chemical compounds in oxidation states and mercury i compounds are weak oxidizing agents and weak reducing agents most of them are colorless they easily disproportionate to mercury ii compounds and mercury metal they react with oxygen in the air to make mercury ii compounds many mercury i compounds do not dissolve in water mercury i chloride is one of the most common mercury i compounds mercury ii compounds are strong oxidizing agents and very corrosive mercury ii compounds are red yellow or colorless mercury ii oxide and mercury ii chloride are the most common mercury ii compounds in the laboratory one thing they have in common is that they are all toxic the soluble ones are more toxic than the insoluble ones mercury i compounds also known as mercurous compounds these are weak reducing agents and weak oxidizing agents most of them do not dissolve in water making them less toxic than mercury ii compounds most of them are colorless or yellow mercury i bromide insouble white solid mercury i chloride calomel insoluble white mercury i fluoride light yellow mercury i iodide a little soluble unstable yellow mercury i nitrate very slightly soluble white mercury i sulfate light yellow solid mercury ii compounds also known as mercuric compounds these are strong oxidizing agents most of them dissolve in water making them very toxic they are colorless or red mercury ii bromide white solid mercury ii chloride white solid corrosive sublimate mercury ii fluoride white solid mercury ii iodide somewhat soluble bright red mercury ii oxide orange yellow or red does not dissolve in water like most oxides mercury ii nitrate soluble white used to make hats mercury ii sulfate white solid mercury ii sulfide red solid organomercury compounds these contain mercury reacted with a organic molecule they are even more toxic than other mercury compounds since they get absorbed very easily dimethylmercury colorless extremely toxic liquid occurrence small blobs of liquid mercury as an element along with streaks of cinnabar another rock with liquid mercury on it mercury is a rare metal it is about as common as silver mercury is not expensive like silver because the mercury is very easy to get from the places where it is found mercury can be found in elemental liquid form in nature but this is not common mercury as an element is the only liquid that is recognized as a mineral by the international mineralogical association it is most often found in the form of cinnabar a mercury ii sulfide mineral the biggest deposits of cinnabar used to be found in spain but now are found in china it also occurs in other minerals like calomel a mercury i chloride mineral preparation china and kyrgyzstan are the two main makers of mercury mines in italy the united states and mexico have been closed china is opening more mines because the european union wants to use fluorescent lights which need mercury mercury is made by roasting cinnabar in a furnace the sulfide is oxidized to sulfur dioxide leaving mercury behind uses of mercury medical uses mercury has been used in dental fillings until it was replaced with safer materials they are an amalgam of mercury with another element an organic mercury compound called thiomersal is used to preserve vaccines merbromin another organic mercury compound is used as an antiseptic it has been banned in some countries like the us mercury i chloride also known as calomel or mercurous chloride has been used as a diuretic skin disinfectant and laxative together with other mercury compounds mercury ii chloride also known as mercuric chloride or corrosive sublimate was used to treat syphilis the problem with this was that mercury ii chloride is very toxic sometimes the symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat it is also used as a disinfectant blue mass a pill or syrup in which mercury is the main ingredient was prescribed throughout the s for different conditions such as constipation depression child bearing and toothaches in the early th century mercury was given to children once a year as a laxative and dewormer teething powders for infants also had it in them since the s some vaccines have contained the preservative thiomersal in the body this is changed to ethylmercury at first it was thought that this mercury based preservative can cause or trigger autism in children but scientific studies could not show such a link because of this thiomersal has been removed from most u s vaccines recommended for children six years of age and under there are certain exceptions to this rule for influenza vaccines in some cases vaccines may still have very small amounts of thiomersal in them cinnabar is still an important component of traditional chinese tibetan and ayurvedic medicine certain countries do not allow the use of mercury or its compounds in drugs for this reason cinnabar has recently been replaced with less toxic products today the use of mercury in medicine has greatly declined in all respects especially in developed countries thermometers and blood pressure devices using mercury were invented in the early th and late th centuries respectively now their use is declining and has been banned in some countries states and medical institutions in the u s senate passed legislation to phase out the sale of non prescription mercury thermometers in washington and maine became the first states to ban mercury blood pressure devices mercury compounds are in some over the counter drugs including topical antiseptics stimulant laxatives diaper rash ointment eye drops and nasal sprays the fda has inadequate data to establish general recognition of the safety and effectiveness of the mercury in these products mercury is still used in some diuretics although other things can be used for most therapeutic uses other uses mercury is also used in cosmetics thiomersal is widely used to make mascara as a liquid electrolyte in a variant of the chloralkali process in mining especially of gold and silver in mercury vapor lamps and fluorescent lamps certain thermometers barometers and manometers because of its toxicity it can be replaced by alcohol for most of these uses certain electrical switches that turn on or off when tilted in the worldwide use of mercury was less than half of what it was in toxicity mercury is liquid at room temperature and fumes of mercury are very poisonous ingested elemental mercury is less dangerous the biggest problems are organic mercury compounds which are eaten with food as with other heavy metals inorganic compounds such as mercury ii nitrate are also highly toxic by ingestion eating or inhalation breathing in of the dust mercury can cause both chronic and acute poisoning in the year over people died of mercury poisoning on the ship triumph because a barrel of mercury had leaked mercury is extremely poisonous and has to be used carefully when mercury is spilled there are special ways to clean it up smaller drops should be combined to a larger drop on hard surfaces to be removed more easily for example being pushed into a bag that can be thrown away vacuum cleaners and brooms should not be used this is because they can spread mercury even more afterwards elements such as sulfur or zinc powder should be sprinkled over the place then collected and cleaned away it is not easy to clean mercury entirely off clothing so it is better not to use them anymore breathing in mercury vapor is also very dangerous related pages mercury compounds list of common elements periodic table references world map showing where africa is africa is the

modern human beings and leads to its present difficult state as a politically developing continent africa s ancient historic period includes the rise of egyptian civilization the further development of societies outside the nile river valley and the interaction between them and civilizations outside of africa in the late th century north and east africa were heavily influenced by the spread of islam that led to the appearance of new cultures such as those of the swahili people and the mali empire whose king musa keita i became one of the richest and most influential people of the early th century this also led to an increase in the slave trade that had a very bad influence for the development of the whole continent until the th century slavery slavery has long been practised in africa between the seventh and twentieth centuries the arab slave trade took million slaves from africa via trans saharan and indian ocean routes between the fifteenth and the nineteenth centuries years the atlantic slave trade took an estimated million slaves to the new world between and the british navy captured approximately slave ships and freed africans who were aboard areas of africa under the control or influence of european nations in at outbreak of world war i colonialism in the late nineteenth century the european powers occupied much of the continent creating many colonial and dependent territories they left only three fully independent states darwiish state also spelled daraawiish state ethiopia known to europeans as abyssinia and liberia egypt and sudan were never formally incorporated into any european colonial empire however after the british occupation of egypt was effectively under british administration until modern history african independence movements

after the summer much of north africa is dry and hot it is dominated by the sahara desert and does not receive much rain in saharan africa there are few rivers or other water sources underground water sources such as springs are very important in the desert these often form oases an oasis is an area of vegetation plant life surrounded by desert in that part of the world the wind comes mostly from the east that does bring rain but the himalayas and the tibetan plateau blocks the monsoon rain and prevents it getting to north africa also the atlas mountains near the north coast of africa prevent rain from coming in from the north that is another rain shadow these two rain shadows are mainly responsible for the sahara desert conditions and winds are different further south where huge amounts of rain falls near the equator the equator runs across the middle of africa see red line drawn on map that means much of africa is between the two tropics tropic of cancer tropic of capricorn plants

its allies between the end of world war ii and the fall of the soviet union conflicting countries alt map of europe with mostly blue nato areas in west and mostly red warsaw pact areas in east most of the countries on one side were allied in nato whose most powerful country was the united states most of the countries on the other side were allied in the warsaw pact whose most powerful country was the soviet union the western capitalist group of countries includes western europe the americas turkey israel japan south korea thailand iran pakistan malaysia philippines south africa australia and new zealand the eastern socialist group includes eastern europe soviet union angola ethiopia cuba mongolia north korea china and vietnam background the start of the cold war in was due to a belief that all governments would become either communist or capitalist the western allies feared that the soviet union would use force to expand its influence in europe and was especially concerned that soviet agents had obtained information on making the atom bomb after the war both groups of nations had opposed nazi germany the soviet union had sporadically co operated with germany and shared in the division of poland in but germany turned against the soviet union in june with operation barbarossa after world war ii big three at the yalta conference winston churchill franklin d roosevelt and joseph stalin early after wwii germany was left in ruins the victorious allies that occupied it split it into four parts one part was given to the united kingdom one part to france one part to the united states and the eastern part was occupied by the ussr the city of berlin was also partitioned among the four parties even though the ussr had conquered it winston churchill harry s truman and joseph stalin at the potsdam conference mid the federal republic of germany bundesrepublik deutschland or brd was recognized by the western allies in june from april to may the soviets blockaded west berlin which led to the berlin airlift the ussr named their section of germany the german democratic republic deutsche demokratische republik or ddr later in the western parts of berlin were called west berlin inside the ddr the berlin wall built in divided the two parts of berlin and was part of the iron curtain that divided europe the s president truman signs the national security act amendment of with guests in the oval office espionage spying has been around for a long time and was very important during the cold war after its successful nuclear espionage in the manhattan project the ussr built up its spy organs especially the kgb the central intelligence agency led us efforts abroad while the fbi did counterespionage catching foreign spies was among kgb functions as well as fighting domestic subversion in the ussr the dictator joseph stalin died and nikolai bulganin and nikita khrushchev took his place khrushchev later took sole control of the ussr khrushchev s secret speech marked a period of de stalinization and khrushchev tried to undo many of the things stalin did such as the gulag prison camps and cult of personality in the united states there was a red scare and when the ussr detonated its own atom bomb there was a great deal of political fallout famous people in many fields who had been communist sympathizers in the past lost their positions many actors were blacklisted and were not hired to act in movies ruining their careers senator joseph mccarthy accused some important americans of being communists including some high government officials mao zedong and joseph stalin in moscow december general douglas macarthur un command cic seated observes the naval shelling of incheon from the uss mt mckinley september the s were the beginning of the space race between the united states and ussr it began with the ussr putting the sputnik satellite into orbit around the earth making the soviet union the first country in space the united states responded by starting nasa and soon sent up its own satellites the soviet union also sent the first man yuri gagarin into earth orbit claiming that this proved communism was the better ideology in the s the united states under president dwight eisenhower created a policy called new look cutting defense spending and increasing the number of nuclear weapons as a deterrent in order to prevent the soviet union from attacking the usa the ussr also increased their nuclear force resulting in mutual assured destruction in the suez crisis of the cold war alliances were broken for the first time with the soviet union and united states favouring one side and britain and france the other later that year the western allies did not interfere when soviet troops suppressed an anti communist revolution in hungary united states vice president richard nixon engaged in several talks with nikita khrushchev during the s one of these was the kitchen debate in a model kitchen in moscow these debates highlighted the political and economic differences between the usa and the ussr the following year the united states u spy plane crashed in the soviet union tensions between the two countries increased cuban missile crisis flag of the th of july movement leonid brezhnev and richard nixon during brezhnev s june visit to washington this was a high water mark in dtente between the united states and the soviet union after the united states tried to invade cuba and failed bay of pigs the soviet union attempted to supply cuba with nuclear missiles these missiles in cuba would have allowed the soviet union to effectively target almost the entire united states in response the united states sent a large number of ships to blockade cuba thus preventing the soviet union from delivering these weapons the united states and soviet union came to agreement that the soviet union would no longer give nuclear weapons to cuba as long as the united states does not invade cuba again this was the highest period of tension during the cold war and it was the closest the world came to a nuclear war with possible global conflict to follow dtente after the agreement that ended the cuban missile crisis relations between the two sides eased up several treaties designed to reduce the number of nuclear weapons were signed during this period of dtente the united states began building a good relationship with china a previous ally of russia the end of the cold war reagan speaks at the berlin wall s brandenburg gate inspiring gorbachev to tear down this wall the policy of dtente ended in when the u s president ronald reagan ordered a massive military massing to challenge the soviet union s influence around the world the united states began to support anti communists all over the world with money and weapons the idea was to help them overthrow their communist governments the soviet union had a slow economy during this decade because military spending was at an all time high they tried to keep up with the united states in military spending but could not in the soviet war in afghanistan starting in the soviet union had a difficult time fighting resistance groups some of them armed and trained by the united states the soviet union s failed invasion of afghanistan is often compared to the united states failure during the vietnam war inf treaty at the white house in the late s the new soviet president mikhail gorbachev made an effort to make an ally of the united states to fix world problems caused by the war with the ultimate aim of eliminating nuclear weapons completely however this did not take place because the president of the united states ronald reagan insisted on having a nuclear missile defense system the people of the soviet union were divided on their feelings about this some wanted president gorbachev to fight harder to eliminate nuclear weapons while others did not want him to be talking to the united states at all these mixed feelings created an atmosphere of political in fighting and the people were no longer united behind one goal because of this the communist party started to crumble after the fall of the berlin wall in and without communist rule holding together the countries that comprised the soviet union the ussr broke into smaller countries like russia ukraine lithuania and georgia the nations of eastern europe returned to capitalism and the period of the cold war was over the soviet union ended in december not all historians agree on when the cold war ended some think it ended when the berlin wall fell others think it ended when the soviet union collapsed in references other websites cold war citizendium the area highlighted in yellow is mainland china mainland china also called the chinese mainland is the part of china not including the republic of china controlling taiwan kinmen matsu and the pescadores the term also excludes hong kong and macau in the qing dynasty all of mainland china hong kong macau taiwan kinmen matsu the pescadores and mongolia were part of the chinese empire taiwan hong kong and macau were given to foreigners for some years taiwan to the japanese hong kong to the british and macau to the portuguese by the end the qing empire china became nationalist china the republic of china and it got taiwan back in after the communists the people s republic of china took over most of china the nationalists kept only taiwan kinmen matsu and the pescadores mongolia became an independent state later since then communist china only includes the part on the continent mainland and some small islands that are very near the largest communist island is hainan this region is mainland china later hong kong and macau were returned to the government of china but because the government calls them special administrative regions under a one country two systems idea they are still not thought of as part of mainland china beijing the capital of china is the largest capital in the world a capital city or capital town or just capital is a city or town specified by law or constitution by the government of a country or part of a country such as a state province or county it usually serves as the location of the government s central meeting place and offices most of the country s leaders and officials work in the capital city size capitals are usually among the largest cities in their regions often they are the biggest for example montevideo is uruguay s capital as well as its biggest city the capital city may also be the most important center of commerce as in london or bangkok however a capital is not always the largest city in a country for example the capital of the india is new delhi which is smaller than mumbai and the capital of pakistan is islamabad which is smaller than karachi also in countries with subdivisions like the united states the capital cities or towns of the federated states are often not the largest or most populated town for example new york city is the biggest city in the united states and in new york but is not the capital of either an unusual case exists in canada the federal capital ottawa is not the largest city in its province ontario which is toronto but toronto happens to be the capital of the province of ontario this way toronto is both a capital and a non capital depending on how you see it as a city in a country or part of it number some countries have more than one capital often for different purposes like bolivia which has two sucre and la paz and south africa which has three pretoria cape town and bloemfontein in a city state such as singapore or monaco or the vatican city the capital is the country not all countries have capitals nauru is a country that does not officially have a capital but the district of yaren which is where the government is can be called the de facto capital also although many people consider the city of bern in switzerland to be the capital of the country it is in fact not the case by law but has the status of federal city by the government which is based there location capitals can be in cities that are already there like london or rome or a new town can be built and made the capital like canberra and alexandria countries can change capitals from time to time several cities have been the capital of china the united states once had its capital in philadelphia and later in new york city but moved to the new city of washington d c in rio de janeiro was the capital of brazil until the new city of brasilia was built between and seat of government most countries have their seat of government within their capital city though some do not malaysia has their capital at kuala lumpur but their seat of government is at putrajaya in the netherlands the constitution says that amsterdam is the de jure capital but the government is in the hague worldwide climate classifications world kppen geiger climate classification map climate means the usual condition of the temperature humidity atmospheric pressure wind rainfall and other meteorological elements in an area of the earth s surface for a long time in simple terms climate is the average condition for about thirty years climate and weather are different weather is the day to day conditions in the atmosphere the types of climates are tropical desert dry temperate polar mediterranean polar climate also called boreal climate characterized by long usually very cold winters and short summers temperate climates have four seasons some of the countries which have a temperate climate are turkey and most of the european countries deserts they just have one or two seasons such as saudi arabia and most of the african countries tropical climates have warm temperature and only two seasons wet and dry an example of a place with a tropical climate is the amazon rainforest in brazil the mediterranean climate is usually hot and dry in summer and is cool and wet in winter an example of a country with a mediterranean climate is spain the latitude ground and height can change the climate of a location it is also important to note if oceans or other large bodies of water are nearby climates are most commonly classified by temperature and precipitation the most commonly used classification was the kppen climate classification first made by wladimir kppen the thornthwaite system which was used from not only uses temperature and precipitation information but evapotranspiration too this makes it useful for studying how many different kinds of animal species there are and about the things that could happen when climates change the bergeron and spatial synoptic classification systems focus more on where the air masses which help make climates come from climates can change after a long time recently the world may be becoming warmer as is discussed in global warming related pages kppen climate classification references very tight folds in new south wales australia a fold in slichowice nature reserve in kielce poland variscan orogeny rainbow basin syncline near barstow california united states rock often deforms in such a way that it bends instead of breaking this is called a fold the term fold is used in geology when one or a stack of originally flat level surfaces such as sedimentary strata are bent or curved as a result of pressure and high temperature the basic cause is likely to be some aspect of plate tectonics when two forces act towards each other from opposite sides rock layers are bent into folds the process by which folds are formed due to compression is known as folding folding is one of the endogenetic processes it takes place within the earth s crust folds in rocks vary in size from microscopic crinkles to mountain sized folds they occur singly as isolated folds and in extensive fold trains of different sizes on a variety of scales a set of folds distributed on a regional scale constitutes a fold belt a common feature of orogenic zones there are large scale and small scale folds large scale folds are found mainly along a collision boundary between two tectonic plates structure of a fold the upfold is called an anticline the downfold is called a syncline the imaginary line joining the highest points along the upfold is called the crest line the flanks of a fold are known as the limbs the central line from which the rock strata dip away in opposing directions is called the axis of fold according to the degree of folding of the layers folds can be classified into five main types symmetrical fold two limbs are of equal steepness asymmetrical fold one limb is steeper than the other overfold one limb is pushed over the other recumbent fold two limbs are nearly parallel overthrust fold compressional force is so great that the rock strata are broken and slide over the other formation of a fold mountain large depressions called geosynclines form between plates seas filled the geosynclines and rivers flowing into them carried sediments sand and silt which build up on the sea bed over millions of years the sediments were compressed by their own weight into sedimentary rocks e g sandstone limestone etc landforms formed by folding large scale folding will develop parallel ranges of round top mountains along destructive plate boundaries these mountains are known as fold mountains examples of fold mountain ranges himalayas alps andes rocky mountains three types of plate boundary volcanism or vulcan activity is the eruption of magma onto the surface of the earth magma under the crust is under very great pressure when folding and faulting occur cracks or fractures appear these are lines of weakness when these lines of weakness develop downward in the crust and reach the magma they will release the pressure in the magma this allows magma to rise up along the lines of weakness and intrude into the crust some magma may even reach the earth s surface as lava volcanoes volcanoes are places where magma reaches the earth s surface the type of volcano depends on the location of the eruption and the consistency of the magma intrusions the main feature of the devils tower national monument was created via intrusion intrusive volcanism is when magma is forced into the rocks that make up the earth s crust when it cools and become solid while still underground different features called plutons are formed the rock formed is intrusive igneous rock these plutons will be exposed at the surface of land when the overlying rocks are removed after a long time of denudation laid bare by erosion major features formed by intrusive volcanicity include batholith laccolith dyke pipe and sill batholiths have large scale magma that has been solidified at the base of the mountain dyke is a small scale magma cooled within the earths crust that stands vertically to the existing rocks sill is small scale magma cooled near the earths surface that lies horizontally to the existing rocks lacolith a small scale magma that pushes the overlying layers of rocks to form a dome shaped structure extrusions the molten magma under great pressure forces its way through the fissure of underground rocks and reaches the earth s surface to form igneous extrusion major extruded materials include gas liquid and solid gas sulphur hydrogen carbon dioxide and hot steam geysers when uprising magma decreases in pressure suddenly gases within magma explode to the earth s surface and cause destruction solid pyroclast mainly composed of country rock fragments of solidified lava and fine materials volcanic ash and dust it can be classified by size into volcanic bombs volcanic blocks lapilli volcanic ash and volcanic dust liquid lava hot springs features formed are caldera a large depression in a former volcanic site when it is filled with water it is called a caldera lake composite cones a large volcanic mountain formed by solidified lava on the surface geysers eruption of hot water and steam shooting into the air at regular intervals hot springs springs of hot water that flow out continuously without shooting up into the air notes other websites a map of the pacific ocean it is ringed by many volcanoes and oceanic trenches the pacific ocean is the body of water between asia and australia in the west the americas in the east the southern ocean to the south and the arctic ocean to the north it is the largest named ocean and it covers one third of the surface of the entire world it joins the atlantic ocean at a line drawn south from cape horn chile argentina to antarctica and joins the indian ocean at a line drawn south from tasmania australia to antarctica as the atlantic slowly gets wider the pacific is slowly shrinking it does this by folding the sea floor in towards the center of the earth this is called subduction this bumping and grinding is hard so there are many earthquakes and volcanoes when the pressure builds up and is quickly released as large explosions of hot rocks and dust when an earthquake happens under the sea the quick jerk causes a tsunami this is why tsunamis are more common around the edge of the pacific than anywhere else many of the earth s volcanoes are either islands in the pacific or are on continents within a few hundred kilometers of the ocean s edge plate tectonics are another reason which makes pacific ocean

antarctic circle around antarctica is the southern ocean it is the fifth largest continent in area after asia africa north america and south america about of antarctica is covered by ice this ice averages at least kilometers miles thick antarctica is the coldest driest and windiest continent it is also on average the highest of all the continents antarctica is considered a desert it has yearly precipitation of only mm inches near the sea and far less inland no humans live in antarctica permanently however about to people live through the year at the science stations in antarctica only plants and animals that can live in cold live there the animals include penguins seals nematodes tardigrades and mites plant life includes some grass and shrubs algae lichen fungi and bacteria the first known sighting of the continent was in antarctica was mostly forgotten for the rest of the th century this was because of its hostile environment few resources and isolation the first official use of the name antarctica as a continental name in the s is said to have been used by scottish cartographer john george bartholomew the antarctic treaty was signed in by countries more countries have signed the treaty since then so far countries have signed the treaty the treaty declares that military activities and mineral mining are against the law however it supports scientific research it also helps the continent s ecozone more than scientists from different nations and different interests experiment together geography and geology satellite composite image of antarctica antarctica is covered by an ice sheet about four kilometres thick under the ice it is mostly land although the ice shelves are over the ocean the transantarctic mountains divide the land between east antarctica in the eastern hemisphere and west antarctica in the western hemisphere antarctica has some important features hidden by the ice one is lake vostok which has been covered by ice for at least million years the lake is km long and km wide another is the huge gamburtsev mountain chain which are the size of the alps yet entirely buried under the ice the gamburtsev range has a nearby massive rift valley similar to the east african great rift valley it is called the lambert system scientists used radar that can work under ice to survey the whole of antarctica life in antarctica adelie penguin chicks in antarctica with ms explorer and an iceberg in the background plants few land plants grow in antarctica this is because antarctica does not have much moisture water sunlight good soil or a warm temperature plants usually only grow for a few weeks in the summer however moss lichen and algae do grow the most important organisms in antarctica are the plankton which grow in the ocean animals one important source of food in the antarctic is the krill which is a general term for the small shrimp like marine crustaceans krill are near the bottom of the food chain they feed on phytoplankton and to a lesser extent zooplankton krill are a food form suitable for the larger animals for whom krill makes up the largest part of their diet whales penguins seals and even some of the birds that live in antarctica all depend on krill whales are the largest animals in the ocean and in antarctica they are mammals not fish that means that they breathe air and do not lay eggs many different kinds of whales live in the oceans around antarctica whalers have hunted whales for hundreds of years for meat and blubber nowadays most whaling is done in the antarctic area penguins only live south of the equator several different kinds live in and around antarctica the biggest ones can stand nearly feet m tall and can weigh almost pounds kg the smallest kinds are only about one foot cm tall penguins are large birds that swim very well but cannot fly they have black backs and wings with white fronts their feathers are very tightly packed and make a thick cover they also have a layer of woolly down under the feathers the feathers themselves are coated with a type of oil that makes them waterproof a thick layer of blubber also keeps them warm penguins eat fish and are at home in the ocean they come up on the land or ice to lay their eggs and raise the chicks they nest together in a huge group history of its discovery this snow surface is what most of antarctica s surface looks like antarctica is bigger than europe for a long time people had believed that there was a great continent in the far south of earth they thought this terra australis would balance the lands in the north like europe asia and north africa people have believed this from the times of ptolemy st century ad he suggested this idea to keep the balance of all known lands in the world pictures of a large land in the south were common in maps in the late th century people discovered that south america and australia were not part of the mythical antarctica however geographers still believed that antarctica was much bigger than it really was european maps continued to show this unknown land until captain james cook s ships hms resolution and adventure crossed the antarctic circle on january in december they crossed it again in january in fact cook did come within about of the antarctic coast however he was forced to go back because of ice in january the first confirmed sighting of antarctica were by three different men according to different organizations ships captained by three men saw antarctica in the three men were fabian von bellingshausen a captain in the russian imperial navy edward bransfield a captain in the royal navy and nathaniel palmer an american seal hunter out of stonington connecticut the first recorded landing on mainland antarctica was by the american sealer john davis he landed on west antarctica on february however some historians are not sure about this claim people began discovering different parts of antarctica and mapping them this was slow work because they could only work in the summer at last a map was made and people began to talk about exploring the land not only the sea however this would have been very hard work they would have to break through the ice that was around antarctica then they would have to land on it and bring in enough things to live on while they explored the land the first serious exploration of the antarctic land was the nimrod expedition led by ernest shackleton in they were the first to climb mount erebus and to reach the south magnetic pole shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in december february they were the first humans to cross the ross ice shelf and the transantarctic mountain range via the beardmore glacier they were the first to set foot on the south polar plateau robert falcon scott the most well known of all of the explorers wanted to be the first man to reach the south pole at the same time another team from norway lead by roald amundsen started they both raced each other to the south pole but in the end amundsen won because he had made a good use of his sleigh dogs scott had used ponies and motor sleds but when he got to the south pole he found a message from amundsen showing that he had beaten scott on his way back scott and three companions met a blizzard and froze to death while waiting for it to finish the people who found him eight months later also found his records and diary which he had written to the day he died climate change and global warming are showing effects in antarctica particularly the antarctic peninsula people people of the antarctic live in there for a short time to learn more about antarctica so most of the people who live there are scientists most are in national science stations on the coast some bases are far from the sea for example at the south pole they study the weather animals glaciers and the earth s atmosphere some scientists drill ice cores to find out about the weather long ago people who work in the antarctic must be careful because a blizzard can start any time and any where when they go far away from their shelter they must always take lots of food just in case today people explore antarctica using snowmobiles which are faster than dogs and can pull heavier loads many come to antarctica just for a short visit as a trip there are companies in south america that have vacations to antarctica so people pay to go there in a ship some people may just take their own boats related pages list of uninhabited regions references related pages list of rivers of antarctica other websites western antarctica warming confirmed december usa today south geographic pole south magnetic pole south geomagnetic pole south pole of inaccessibility the south pole is the most southern point on the earth it is in antarctica and is the center of the southern hemisphere from the south pole everywhere is north the geographic north and south poles are the poles the earth spins around the ones people see on a globe where all the north south lines meet these poles stay in the same place and are usually the ones we mean if we just say north or south pole people can tell that they are at these poles by looking at the stars at the poles a star just circles around at the same height never dipping to the horizon the sun rises once a year and gives the south pole half a year of summer but it is always cold when the sun sets half a year later it makes half a year of winter which is even colder the south pole is always cold because the sun never rises high in the sky the south magnetic pole is something different it is defined by the earth s magnetic field as roughly where a magnetic compass needle points people can tell they are near these poles by looking at a compass exploration the south pole is hard to reach unlike the north pole which is covered by the sea and flat sea ice the south pole is on a mountainous continent this continent is called antarctica it is covered by thick ice more than a mile thick in the centre the south pole is very high up and is very windy it is far from places where people live and ships going there often have to find their way through thick sea ice once ashore land travelling explorers have to travel more than a thousand miles to get to the pole they must cross a floating ice shelf then up onto the ice covered land up steep mountain glaciers covered in broken twisted ice slowly sliding to the sea and across a high level land plateau covered in ice and swept by strong freezing winds two expeditions early in the th century led by robert falcon scott and then ernest shackleton failed to reach the south pole but returned safely shackleton turned back quite close to the pole but it was late in the season and supplies were low he knew that he would be risking the lives of his men so he turned back the first men to reach the south pole were a group from norway led by roald amundsen they arrived at the pole on december and left the norwegian flag amundsen and his men returned home safely amundsen s story is one of excellent planning good leadership and willingness to learn from others this made extreme endurance unnecessary and perhaps made the successful expedition less of a story and therefore perhaps less famous than the next one the most famous south pole expedition is perhaps the one that failed badly this was the british expedition not just uk it included people from the british empire who at that time were considered british citizens led by robert falcon scott scott and four other men dragging their equipment on sledges had hoped to be first to the pole when they arrived they saw a norwegian flag a letter left for scott showed that amundsen and his men had beaten them by a month by using dogs to pull their sledges on their journey back from the pole scott s team found that food dumps were short of supplies particularly kerosene kerosene was very important not just for cooking but for melting ice once it ran out they would have no water to drink one man collapsed and died while walking oates knew his frostbitten feet could not carry him back to base and that he might delay his companions and risk their lives he committed suicide by walking out of their tent into the cold scott and his remaining two companions died of starvation thirst and cold trapped in the tent by bad weather until their supplies ran out next spring the three bodies in the tent were found by a team from the main part of the expedition who had spent the winter in the expeditions s hut by the sea scott s letters to his wife written in the tent when he knew he was going to die have just jan been made public apart from ernest shackleton s expedition to cross the antarctic another heroic failure but shackleton saved all his men after a very courageous sea crossing in an open boat and a crossing of an unknown mountain range while starving and freezing this was the end of the heroic age of exploration motors planes radios and gps ensured that following expeditions were never truly unsupported today there is an american science base at the south pole it is named the amundsen scott south pole station to honor the two explorers climate the south pole has a desert climate it almost never gets any precipitation air humidity is near zero however high winds can cause the blowing of snowfall and the accumulation of snow amounts to about per year the former dome seen in pictures of the amundsen scott station is partially buried due to snow storms and the entrance to the dome had to be regularly bulldozed to uncover it more recent buildings are raised on stilts so that the snow does not build up against the sides references related pages north pole the

very cold places of northern canada greenland the arctic and alaska they are sometimes called eskimos a word which likely comes from the algonquin language and may mean eater of raw meat most inuit prefer to be called by their own name either the more general inuit particularly in canada or their actual tribe name inuit is a tribe name but not all indigenous arctic peoples in north america are inuits particularly in the united states alaska the word eskimo would be accepted as a more general term but would probably refer to themselves by their tribe name inuit in canada and greenland like the name inuit because it is their own name for themselves inuit means more than one one person is an inuk the native greenlanders are related to the inuit the language of the inuit is inuktitut and it is one of the official languages of nunavut and of the northwest territories in canada eskimo is a term more frequently used in mainstream united states where such concerns get less attention inuits in alaska have various concerns such as protecting the caribou from american oil pipelines anti seal hunt campaigns work to eliminate this aspect of northern culture which most inuits regard as vital to their lives traditional culture inuit ate both raw and cooked meat and fish as well as the fetus s of pregnant animals whale blubber was burned as fuel for cooking and lamps inuit were also nomadic people but they did not domesticate any animals except for dogs which they used to pull their sleds and help with the hunting they were hunter gatherers living off the land they were very careful to make good use of every part of the animals they killed respect for the land and the animals they harvested was and is a focal part of their culture inuit lived in tents made of animal skins during the summer in the winter they lived in sod houses and igloos they could build an igloo out of snow bricks in just a couple of hours snow is full of air spaces which helps it hold in warmth with just a blubber lamp for heat an igloo could be warmer than the air outside the inuit made very clever things from the bones antlers and wood they had they invented the which was used to hunt seals and whales they built boats from wood or bone covered with animal skins they invented the kayak for one man to use for hunting the ocean and among the pack ice inuit sleds could be built from wood bone or even animal skins wrapped around frozen fish dishes were made from carving soapstone bones or musk ox horns they wore two layers of skins one fur side in the other facing out to stay warm inuit had to be good hunters to survive when an animal was killed in a hunt it was thanked respectfully for offering itself to the hunter they believed it intended to provide itself as a gift towards the survival of the hunter and his children their gratitude was deeply sincere and is an important aspect of their belief system in the winter seals did not come out onto the ice they only came up for air at holes they chewed in the ice inuit would use their dogs to find the air holes then wait patiently until the seal came back to breathe and kill it with a in the summer the seals would lie out on the ice enjoying the sun the hunter would have to slowly creep up on a seal to kill it the inuit would use their dogs and spears to hunt polar bears musk ox and caribou sometimes they would kill caribou from their boats as the animals crossed the rivers on their migration the inuit even hunted whales from their boat they would throw harpoons that were attached to floats made of seal skins the whale would grow tired from dragging the floats under the water when it slowed down and came up to the surface the inuit could keep hitting it with more harpoons or spears until it died whale blubber provide vitamin d and omegas to their cultural diet and prevented rickets the whaling industry around the world has depleted the whale population and now traditional whale hunting for subsistence purposes is rare around the world inuits have added to their modern northern diet with grocery foods which are normally very expensive in the north during the summer months the inuit were able to gather berries and roots to eat they also collected grass to line their boots or make baskets often the food they found or killed during the summer was put into a cache for use during the long winter a cache was created by digging down to the permafrost and building a rock lined pit there the top would be covered with a pile of rocks to keep out the animals it was as good as a freezer because the food would stay frozen there until the family needed it inuit cultural traditions and traditional stories provided each new generation with the lifeskills and knowledge to survive their environment and work together they usually moved around in small groups looking for food and sometimes they would get together with other groups to hunt for larger animals such as whales the men did the hunting and home building and also made weapons sleds and boats the women cooked made the clothes and took care of the children children and infants under the ages of became easy victims of hypothermia and if they were to die their mothers would weight the children s corpses with stones and wrap them in fishnets before placing the bodies through holes in the ice the mothers believed the children s souls were being offered to the god phallus who would reincarnate them as whales north american arctic people today today most inuit live in modern houses many still hunt or fish for a major part of their food supply and sometimes some income seal pelts are used to protect from the extreme cold in the arctic and are far more effective than man made fabrics the technology was worked well for many thousands of years besides commercial winterwear is expensive they use rifles and snowmobiles when hunting now however traditional values respecting the animals hunted still very much applies in alaska many of the people have received money from the oil discovered in that state on their traditional lands the arctic is very different from the rest of the world that the way of life in the south does not work well in the north canada values having inuit peoples in canada s northernmost lands as proof of sovereignty over the canadian portion of the arctic circle it s a very challenging living in an arctic environment there is some controversy over the practice of sinking the corpses of child victims of hypothermia under the ice as bodies have been known to drift through the currents and wash up on the eastern coast of canada and upon occasion the northeastern united states four kinds of baskets a basket is a container it is usually light basket makers use a wide variety of materials to create a

signals and turn them into pictures and sound the word television comes from the words tele greek for far away and vision sight sometimes a television can look like a box older tvs had a large cathode ray tube in a large wooden frame and sat on the floor like furniture newer tvs are much lighter and flatter a tv can show pictures from many television networks computers and mobile devices also can be used for watching television programs television was invented in the s but the equipment was expensive and the pictures were poor by the s these problems had been fixed and tvs became widespread at first all televisions used an antenna or aerial this would pick up television programmes from broadcasting stations a tv station could be many miles or kilometers away and still be received tvs can also show movies from vcd and dvd players or vcrs cable tv and satellite television can provide more programs at once than broadcast can video game consoles connect to most modern tvs some computers can also use a tv as a computer monitor all tvs have screens where the picture is viewed before the s these were usually black and white which made everything look grey but all modern tvs show colors most th century screens also had rounded corners that is because television screens were cathode ray tubes these are like heavy glass jars with one side bulging out to form the screen today flat panel displays are the usual kind these are usually flat rectangles with straight edges this long rectangle looks more like the shape of a movie theatre screen this is called widescreen if a widescreen set was cm tall it would be cm wide for this to work best tv shows also need to be made in widescreen widescreen sets can still be any size but they have the same widescreen shape the early st century is

groups sociology is a social science people who study sociology are called sociologists a society is the community of people living in a particular country or region and having shared customs laws and organizations emmanuel joseph sieys in was first to use the term the problems caused by the change to an industrial society where many people moved to cities and worked in factories were an early focus of sociology auguste comte max weber and mile durkheim were leading figures in the study of social phenomena themes included community authority status alienation and lack of power in the s some sociologists look at such things as race ethnicity class gender the family and social interaction they also study the breakdown of social structures crime and divorce work of sociologists sociologists research the structures that organize society such as race gender whether a person is male or female and social classes rich or poor they study the family and examine problems such as crime and drug abuse most sociologists work in one or more specialty areas or sub fields sociology includes many sub fields that examine different aspects of society for example social stratification studies inequality and class structure in society the field of demography studies changes in population size or type the field of criminology examines criminal behavior and crime political sociology studies government and laws sociology of race and sociology of gender examine how people think about race and gender many sociologists also do research outside of the university their research is supposedly intended to help teachers lawmakers and government administrators to make better institutions government programs and rules sociologists often use statistics to count and measure patterns in how people act or behave sociologists also interview people or hold group discussions to find out why people behave in certain ways some sociologists combine different research methods history of sociology social analysis has been done since the time of plato sociology became accepted as a type of science in the early s european cities were changing as many people moved into cities and began working in factories sociologists tried to understand how people interacted and how groups interacted the word sociology was invented by french thinker emmanuel joseph sieys in early thinkers who wrote about sociology included auguste comte and max weber sociology was taught in a university for the first time at the university of kansas in the first european department of sociology was founded

sky with trees colors of the sky at different times sunset in london the sky is what we call the appearance of the atmosphere around the surface of the planet from our point of view we see many objects that are actually in space such as the sun the moon and stars because they are in the sky on a clear day the sky appears blue at night it appears the deepness of the blue increases as we look toward the horizon and up to the point above us the sky which is made up of gas molecules is blue because of the random scattering of sunlight by the molecules rayleigh scattering defines the amount of scattering of light rays blue light scatters much more than red which is why the sky appears blue on a clear day depending on the time of day the sky may appear different colors at dawn or dusk the sky may appear red orange or even green and purple depending on how low the sun is and how close it is to night other planets have skies too because the types of gases in their atmospheres are different they have different sky colors for example the sky on mars is red many things can be seen in the sky there are objects from space like the sun moon and stars there are also many weather events seen in the sky for example these can be clouds rain lightning or fog weather is caused by different patterns and temperatures in the atmosphere other things that can be seen in the sky are

different tones which are like pitches in music but with a smaller number changes the meaning of a word even if the pronunciation of the word is otherwise the same many asian languages are tone languages such as chinese vietnamese thai and punjabi most languages including indo european languages such as english are not tone languages moreover many african languages like yorb igbo ewe and zulu use tone as well in some languages it is pitch accent that is important instead that means that a word s meaning can be different if a different syllable is stressed examples include hebrew swedish norwegian serbo croatian lithuanian and some asian languages like japanese however pitch accent is not the same as tones some tones may sound alike to people who do not speak a tone language they are the most difficult part of learning a tone language for those people example in mandarin the sentence ma ma ma ma includes four different words if numbers identify the tones they can be written ma ma ma ma which means the hemp s mother scolds the horse some ways of romanization write each tone with a different spelling ma ma ma ma in pinyin would be written ma mha mah maa in gwoyeu romatzyh romanization most use numbers or accent marks m m m m in pinyin there is a passage called lion eating poet in the stone den it has characters all read the same way in mandarin shi but with different tones mandarin does not have many syllables the words for mother hemp horse scold and a word put at the end of sentences to make it a question are all pronounced ma mother is ma that is high and level hemp is ma that starts low and ends high horse is ma that starts fairly high dips very low and then goes back up again scold is ma that starts high and ends low to make a question ma is added at the end but it is kept very soft and short and about the same level mandarin has first tone second tone third tone fourth tone and neutral tone other chinese dialects have more tones some as many as tonal markings vietnamese and pinyin use accents as the tone marks for the latin alphabet each accent shows an altered sound for the syllable most syllables have only one tone marking but the letters in the syllable can be altered by other markings syllables usually form one word in un hyphenated compound words pinyin may have style differences that break from actual use because its use is

another product of the fermentation is carbon dioxide classification from the type of fermentation in general all alcoholic drinks where yeast turns sugar into alcohol are called beer in these cases distillation is not used the difference to wine is that with wine sugars from plants such as fruit sugar or that made by animals is used as an example mead is a wine made from honey japanese sake is made from rice and uses yeast for fermentation so even if some people call it rice wine sake is really a kind of beer making beer the act of making beer is called brewing beer is made by adding warm water to malted barley and other grains the enzymes in the barley change the malted barley and other grains into simple sugars this is called the mash the water is then sparged drained from the grain the water is now called wort the wort is boiled and hops are added hops provide flavour and preserve the beer after boiling the wort is cooled and yeast is added the yeast turns the sugars into alcohol and the wort into beer different beers can have different natures depending on the ingredients used for example an ale uses top fermenting yeast top fermenting yeasts eat more sugar and produce more alcohol a lager uses bottom fermenting yeast bottom fermenting yeasts eat less sugar and produce a crisper cleaner taste adding hops makes the beer more bitter and aromatic specialty malts different types of cooked barley produce different flavours and colours these flavours and colours are most notable in dark beers like porter and stout different countries have different ways to make beer in germany austria switzerland czech republic and slovakia beer is usually made from just hops malt water and yeast this is because of the reinheitsgebot the reinheitsgebot was a law that said says that beer can only be made from hops malt and water yeast was discovered after the reinheitsgebot the law was overturned by the european union in in belgium however beers have always been made with wheat sugar fruit and other ingredients different ways to make beer the type of yeast used determines the kind of beer made some kinds of yeast ferment at a higher temperature usually at c the fermentation process is quicker other kinds ferment at a lower temperature usually c beers made with this kind usually have a longer shelf life some beers ferment sponaneously from yeast that can be found in the environment the history of beer the earliest records of beer were written around years ago by the sumerians it is said that the sumerians discovered the fermentation process by accident it is not known exactly how this happened but it could be that a piece of bread or grain became wet and a short time later it began to ferment and made a pulp that caused people to become drunk a seal around years old is a sumerian hymn to ninkasi the goddess of brewing this hymn is also a recipe for making beer a description of the making of beer on this ancient engraving in the sumerian language is the earliest account of what is easily recognised as barley followed by a pictograph of bread being baked crumbled into water to form a mash and then made into a drink that is recorded as having made people feel wonderful and blissful it could even be possible that bread was first baked to be a way to make beer that is easy to carry around the sumerians were probably the first people to brew beer they had found a divine drink they felt it was a gift from the gods amount of alcohol in beer normal beers have around alcohol for the volume i e in ml beer there is ml alcohol in brewing beer the amount of alcohol can be made more or less quite easily the belgian types of beer are made by adding more sugar through the fermentation this will then turn to alcohol today there are beers with between and about of alcohol about the same alcohol content as wine spirits can have up to alcohol some beer labels say there is no alcohol in them because it was taken out later this is not completely true though beers without alcohol usually do have less than of alcohol an ip address is a label which is used to identify one or more devices on a computer network such as the internet it is comparable to a postal address an ip address is a long number written in binary since such numbers are difficult to communicate ip addresses are usually written as a set of numbers in a given order devices using ip addresses use the internet protocol to communicate the internet assigned numbers authority assigns ip addresses to regional internet registries rirs the rirs assign them to internet service providers internet service providers then assign ip addresses to their customers very often people have a router or gateway at home to which they connect computers printers and other devices these routers or gateways are often configured to assign local ip addresses to the devices that are connected each address has two parts one that specifies the computer or group of computers and another which specifies the network a device can have more than one ip address certain types of ip addresses are used to address a group of devices while others are used to address only one device certain types of addresses are unique others can be re used a number of ip addresses are used for special purposes for example to obtain an ip address automatically an ip address is converted to physical or media access control address using the address resolution protocol arp if an ip address is your phone number then your mac address is your name you may change your phone number but your name will not change what an ip address looks like an ip address is a long binary number made of ones and zeros an ipv address is binary digits or bits long an ipv is bits long allowing many more ip addresses to be used ip addresses are usually written in human readable form where bits are grouped into one octet ipv addresses are usually written as a group of four numbers each number can take a value from to ipv addresses are written as a group of eight hexadecimal numbers many ipv addresses contain many zeroes there are special rules which say that in certain cases these zeroes do not need to be written public and private addresses certain ip addresses can be assigned freely on the local area network since they are not unique they are not routed on the internet the addresses which can be freely assigned are called private ip addresses the ones which are unique are called public to be routed a private address needs to be translated into a public one this process of translating between private and public addresses is called network address translation or nat routers and firewalls often also perform this task reaching one or more devices there are three different types of addresses unicast addresses the address is assigned to one specific device this is the most common case most addresses are unicast addresses broadcast addresses address all computers on the same network there are certain cases where this is useful for example to obtain a new address automatically the sender sends the data once and the devices used for routing the data make copies as needed multicast addresses this case is similar to the broadcast case above some devices are interested in receiving certain data and the network copies the data as needed the big difference to the broadcast case above is that all devices connected to the broadcast network see the data sent using broadcast with multicast devices need to subscribe to see a given content the devices on the same network that are not subscribed will not see the content file unicast svg unicast one sender one receiver file broadcast svg broadcast one sender many receivers all on the same sub network all devices see the data file multicast svg multicast one sender many receivers only a selected number of devices usually called subscribers see the data obtaining a new ip address there are different ways of getting a new ip address and not being blocked for vandalism anymore one of them is called bootstrap protocol usually shortened to bootp the device that needs a new address does not know what network it is in so it uses an ip address of all zeroes which it sends as a broadcast to the current network on a special port in addition it sends the mac address of the network card plus a byte random number the bootp server will send a reply also as broadcast addressed to a different port the reply will contain the mac address of the client the random number and the ip address of the client when the client receives the data it will set the address specified if the bootp server is configured that way it will also send the ip address and hostname of the bootp server the name and path to a file which should be loaded to boot the client using tftp or the name of a directory which the client should mount using nfs dhcp extends bootp and allows to send more information such as the address of a time server or information which is useful for routing ip addresses obtained automatically can be dynamic or static static addressing means the same machine will always get the same ip address with dynamic addresses a device will get the next address which is not used dynamic addresses which are used need to be reviewed from time to time if they are not renewed they can be used for other devices ip version with ipv each address consists of four digit binary numbers called octets an ipv address is bits in total the biggest number one can make with regular digits is but the biggest number one can make with binary digits is in binary so each octet can be any number from to an ipv address could look something like this each octet is converted to its decimal form and separated by a period also there are special meanings associated with two different ending numbers in general a last number of stands for the network called base address and a last number of stands for all hosts on that network called broadcast address computers that are on the same local network share of the numbers a computer can be on more than one network it can also have several names public private addresses the problem with ipv is that it only allows for billion addresses and we ve almost used them all to delay this network address translation nat was created network address translation has a network share one public ip address and give every computer on the network a private ip address everyone living in the same house uses the same address but mail can be meant for multiple different people living in the house special ip addresses there are some ip addresses that are reserved for special purposes for example the address is called the loopback address and will loop back any packets sent to this address back to the computer that sent them like sending mail to yourself although this may not seem useful it is used to test servers block starting address ending address number of addresses ipv subnetting to make a network work faster it is split up into subnets to do this an ip address contains a network id subnet id and a host id a special binary number called a subnet mask is used to determine the size of the network subnet and host ids the original ipv only supported networks so in the internet addressing specification was changed to a classful network architecture classful network design allowed for a larger number of individual networks the first three bits of an ip address determined its class three classes a b and c were defined for normal computer communication unicast the size of the network id was based on the class of the ip address each class used more octets for the network id making the host id smaller and reducing the number of possible hosts historical classful network architecture class first octet in binary range of first octet network id host id number of networks number of addresses a xxxxxxx a b c d b xxxxxx a b c d c xxxxx a b c d d xxxx a b c d e classful networks have been replaced by classless inter domain routing cidr since cidr also provides a network address and host address cidr does not have classes which means network and host address sizes don t have to be in octets an ipv address in cidr notation looks like the slash and number represent the amount of bits that the network id uses in this case or octets ip version because ipv is only bits the number of available addresses will run out to prevent this an organization called the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee created ip version ipv which will eventually replace ipv ip version uses octets or bits in total octets in ipv are written in hexadecimal and separated by colons an ipv address might look like this db a a e an ipv address can be long and this can lead to mistakes when typing them into the computer or writing them down there are two ways in which an ipv address can be made shorter without leaving anything out leading zeroes can be left out db b becomes db b any number of sequential all zero chunks may be compressed to simply this can be done only once in the same address db could be written as db other versions versions before ipv were experimental and never widely used version was used exclusively for the internet stream protocol which was also never widely used eurasia is the combined landmass of the continents of europe and asia in the northern part of the earth eurasia is made of europe and asia which are on the same tectonic plate and do not have a sea between them the word is made by adding eur from eur ope to asia to make eurasia some geographers say it s all just one continent because unlike the americas or africa europe and asia are not divided by sea the ancient greeks divided the world they knew into europe asia and africa knowing little of the land north of the black sea they took that and the sea of marmara as dividing europe from asia since then people have been talking about asia and europe as two continents so it is now a tradition some other continents are not completely divided by sea and are joined together and by a thin strip of land called an isthmus like north america and south america however europe and asia are not divided by sea at all sometimes eurasia is divided into west eurasia and east eurasia west eurasia is europe and the middle east historians sometimes add north africa to west eurasia because the sahara desert divides north africa from the other parts of africa and it is as difficult to cross as a sea arctic ocean with north pole the north pole is the point that is farthest north on earth it is the point on which axis of earth turns it is in the arctic ocean and it is cold there because the sun does not shine there for about half a year and never rises very high the ocean around the pole is always very cold and it is covered by a thick sheet of ice there is also a magnetic north pole it is near the physical north pole a compass points toward the magnetic north pole there is a star called the north star or polaris that is always in the sky above the north pole people can tell how far north they are by seeing how high the north star appears in the sky climate related pages south pole references in linguistics noun phrases have grammatical number plural is one kind of grammatical number in english plural noun phrases are counted as more or less than one e g degrees no bananas liters grams two times three fish mothers in contrast a singular noun phrase usually refers to something that you would count as one only e g one time a glass the sun my mother jennifer noun phrases that cannot be counted are also singular in english e g water the meat some space etc in many languages a suffix word ending is added to a word to show that the word is plural in english the normal plural suffix i s s e g cat is singular and cat s is plural plurals in english there are a number of exceptions singulars ending in s are usually the same in plural species mumps innings and so on but proper names ending in s take add es in plural jones becomes the joneses compound words add the plural to the noun part sons in law lord mayors courts martial singulars ending in y become ies in plural if a consonant is before the suffix so day becomes days but spy becomes spies personal names are again an exception the plural of mary is marys singulars ending in f usually changes to ves dwarf to dwarves leaf to leaves and so on special cases some plurals just have to be learnt the plural of person is normally people but sometimes persons is used invariant nouns the common names of animals is often used as both singular and plural one can say we shot grouse today correctly no matter what number were killed with fish there is a choice traditional english usage is that the word is used for both singular and plural but american usage seems to prefer fishes as the plural with groups of animals one uses the singular as in a herd of bison or a shoal of herring but if the animals are known as individuals then for example we feed the ducks or stroke our cats there are other cases where there is no plural at all as with sheep salmon deer other general words which add no suffix in plural are aircraft and offspring some look like singular but are always plural such as vermin livestock cattle people it is fair to say that most native english speakers do make mistakes in this area it is one of the more troublesome aspects of the english language other languages all european languages have plural forms the suffix that is used in each one of these other languages is different from the suffix that is applied to english nouns in other languages such as chinese korean and japanese there is usually no plural

people use the term oceania to include only the polynesian and melanesian islands in the pacific ocean as separate from australasia for these reasons it is not correct to say that australasia is part of oceania because what is meant by oceania is not clear australasia has an exact definition in biogeography and geology australasia includes new zealand australia including tasmania and melanesia new

to be popular the word pop music was used from about onwards when a type of music called music was popular styles of pop music in the s today include rock music electronic dance music and hip hop pop music tends to change quite a lot so the description is quite flexible history modern pop music grew out of s rock and roll for example chuck berry bo diddley and little richard and rockabilly for example elvis presley and buddy holly in the s the beatles became a famous pop music group in the s other styles of music were mixed with pop music such as funk and soul music pop music generally has a heavy strong beat so that it is good for dancing pop singers normally sing with microphones that are plugged into an amplifier and a loudspeaker how does the business of pop music work there are also many more people working on pop music who are not seen on the stage or in the video these people include the studio staff people who help the musicians to record cds and music videos in music studios production staff people who help make the music recordings sound good distribution staff people who help sell the music to stores and retail staff people that sell the music to people at cd stores tour staff help the band to travel around the country or around the world for their concert tours some tour staff help by carrying heavy musical instruments onto the stage other tour staff drive buses or cars so that the band can get to the concert some tour staff operate sound equipment such as the large amplifiers and loudspeakers that are used to amplify make louder the band s music for the audience promotional staff help to market or promote the band s music so that more people will know about the band and buy the band s cds some promotional staff travel to radio stations and give the band s cd to radio station managers or djs disk jockeys the people who announce songs on the radio other promotional staff write press releases short articles about the band which are sent to the newspapers types of music that became pop music pop music came from the rock and roll movement of the early s when record companies recorded songs that they thought that teenagers would like pop music usually uses musical from the other types of music that are popular at the time many different styles of music have become pop music during different time periods often music companies create pop music styles by taking a style of music that only a small number of people were listening to and then making that music more popular by marketing it to teenagers and young adults in the s recording companies took blues influenced rock and roll for example chuck berry and bo diddley and rockabilly for example carl perkins and buddy holly and promoted them as pop music in the late s and early s record companies took folk music bands and musicians and helped them to create a new type of music called folk rock or acid rock folk rock and acid rock mixed folk music blues and rock and roll for example the byrds and janis joplin in the s record companies created several harder louder type of blues called blues rock or heavy metal which became a type of pop music for example the bands led zeppelin and judas priest in the late s and early s a type of nightclub dance music called disco turned into a popular type of pop music record companies took an experimental strange sounding type of music called new wave music from the s and turned it into pop music bands such as the cars in the s record companies took an underground type of hard rock called grunge for example the band nirvana michael jackson was also a very influential artist for pop music his album thriller is the best selling album of all time he also wrote some other very influential songs such as bad give in to me will you be there heal the world we are the world black or white and billie jean just to name a few by the st century after the demise of disco in the s contemporary r b became pop music

with how people react to things that happen around them based on meaning it was created by alfred korzybski during the s and early s the goal of general semantics is for people to know that when we simplify something either mentally or in language that simplification is not the same thing as the thing simplified how people understand reality is not the same as what reality is because people do not know everything about reality general semantics teaches that there is always more to something than what is seen heard felt or believed semiotics or semiology is a theoretical framework for the study of the meaning of language signs and symbols it was first developed in the early th century separately by the swiss ferdinand saussure and charles sanders peirce of the u s a it can be described as both a science and a technique a science because it has its own theories and a technique because it is a way of studying systems of representation and meaning semiotics is usually divided into three parts semantics what was the meaning of the words or signs used pragmatics who said it to whom and in what circumstances and syntactics the formal rules of the language used the major branches of semiotics include biosemiotics zoosemiotics semiotics of culture other page philosophy of language nitrogen is a nonmetal chemical element the atmosphere contains more than percent of nitrogen it has the chemical symbol n and atomic number its stable inside typically contains nucleons protons and neutrons it has electrons in its outer shell properties cup of liquid nitrogen nitrogen is a colorless odorless gas at normal temperature it is normally attached to another nitrogen atom making a nitrogen molecule n this bond is very strong that is why many explosives contain nitrogen the bond is broken when the explosive is made when it explodes the bond forms releasing a lot of energy it turns into a liquid at c and turns into a solid at c if it is compressed it can be turned into a liquid without making it cold it usually does not combine with other atoms because its strong bond prevents it from reacting lithium is one of the few chemical elements that react with nitrogen without being heated magnesium can burn in nitrogen nitrogen also makes blue electric sparks the blue color is caused by the atoms being excited when they get normal again they release light when nitrogen is excited it reacts with many things that it does not normally react with electric spark through a tube filled with nitrogen compounds many chemical compounds that are important for industrial purposes contain nitrogen ions these include ammonia nitric acid nitrates and cyanides nitrogen comes in several oxidation states and each of those oxidation states has its set of compounds compounds in the oxidation state are weak reducing agents these include ammonia ammonium amide and nitrides amino acids and proteins contain nitrogen in this oxidation state hydrazine a compound in the oxidation state is a strong reducing agent azides contain nitrogen in the oxidation state they are extremely powerful reducing agents and most are very toxic nitrous oxide contains nitrogen in the oxidation state it is used as an anesthetic compounds containing nitrogen in the oxidation state such as nitric oxide are reducing agents oxidation state compounds are strong oxidizing agents and weak reducing agents nitrites are the most common compounds compounds in the oxidation state are strong oxidizing agents they include nitrogen dioxide and dinitrogen tetroxide compounds containing nitrogen in the oxidation state are strong oxidizing agents they are one of the more common groups of nitrogen compounds they include nitric acid and dinitrogen pentoxide they also include nitrates which are used in explosives such as dynamite nitroglycerin and trinitrotoluene occurrence and preparation air is made up of about nitrogen and about oxygen argon and traces of other gasses such as carbon dioxide and water vapor among others it is also in a few nitrates in the ground ammonium minerals are rare nitrogen is in proteins pure liquid nitrogen can be made by cooling air the nitrogen turns into a liquid at a different temperature than the oxygen it can also be made by heating certain chemical compounds such as sodium azide uses liquid nitrogen used to freeze a balloon nitrogen is an element is used to prevent things from reacting with the oxygen in the air it can be used to fill crisp bags and incandescent bulbs it is also used to fill some tires it can be used to make electric components like transistors liquid nitrogen can be used to freeze things nitrogen compounds have many uses such as anesthetics nitrous oxide explosives dynamite cleaners ammonia and meat protein and planes fuel history nitrogen was discovered by daniel rutherford in who called it noxious gas or fixed gas they discovered that part of air did not burn it was found that animals died in it it was known as azote many nitrogen compounds also contain the azide or azine letters such as hydrazine in lord rayleigh found out that when a spark was passed through nitrogen it made a reactive form of nitrogen this nitrogen reacted with many metals and compounds related pages list of common elements for the american sport see american football for other sports known as football see football switzerland and albania playing footballa football field association football is a sport played between two teams there were various attempts to codify the rules of football in england in the mid th century the present laws date back to where a ruleset was adopted in rugby warwickshire by the newly formed football association in its country of origin united kingdom it is called football in other countries such as the united states and canada it is called soccer in australia new zealand ireland south africa and japan both words are often used each team has players on the field one of these players is the goalkeeper and the other ten are known as outfield players the game is played by kicking a ball into the opponent s goal a match has minutes of play with a break of minutes during the match the break in the middle is called half time extra time may also be added at the end of the game competitions there are many competitions for football for both football clubs and countries football clubs usually play other teams in their own country with a few exceptions cardiff city f c and swansea city f c from wales for example play in the english leagues and in the english fa cup groups such as uefa and fifa organise international competitions between clubs and countries clubs play in competitions such as uefa champions league or uefa europa league and countries play for the world cup or a continental trophy such as the uefa european football championship the fifa world cup takes place every four years between national teams and is the world s most popular sporting event even more popular than the olympic games in football there are two main types competitions in a league all of the teams play the same number of games but in a cup teams leave the competition when they lose until the last two teams play each other to decide the winner who plays football football is the world s most popular sport it is played in more countries than any other game in fact fifa the federation internationale de football association has more members than the united nations it is played by both males and females in europe the main competitions to compete to be the best in europe are the champions league for the top teams from the top leagues in each country in europe then there is uefa europa league which is for the next best teams from each member of the uefa the most successful club in the world in terms of domestic league results is rangers f c from scotland who have won more domestic league titles than any other team in the world they have won the country s league times which is a world record other successful clubs are fc barcelona and real madrid from spain bayern munich from germany and liverpool and manchester united from england rules fundamental rules note this is not a complete summary the side which scores the most goals wins if scores are equal the result is a draw the officials in a football game are a referee and two linesmen goals are scored by getting the ball into the opponents goal more than halfway across the line referees have access to goal line cameras to decide close cases the offside rule means that there have to be at least two defenders between the attacker and the defenders goal when the attacker s teammate passes the ball to him her this is not a complete summary the rule is complex usually one of the two defenders is the goalkeeper players may not use their hands or arms handball except the goalkeeper who may use them within his own penalty area penalty areas are in front of both goals the ball is out of play if it crosses the field boundaries if a player kicks the ball out of play at the side of the field the other team gets to throw the ball back into play a throw in if a player kicks the ball out of play at their end of the field the other team kicks the ball back into play from the corner a corner kick if a player kicks the ball out of play at the other end of the field the other team kicks the ball back into play from directly in front of the goal a goal kick football is a game of two halves each half is minutes the referee may add time to the end of each half when play is delayed due to injuries or substitutions there is an interval of ten minutes between halves each team is allowed up to three substitutes from the bench during the course of a game no player substituted can return during the game behaviour rules players may not trip or push each other a foul players may not hold each other or stop other players from getting to the ball obstruction when a player scores he is not allowed to jump into the crowd if he does he will get a yellow card the same applies to lifting their shirt in celebration players must not abuse referees in any way verbally or physically players who commit bad fouls get shown a yellow card players who commit really bad fouls or get shown two yellow cards in the same game get shown a red card players who get shown a red card get sent off the field and cannot finish playing the game in some competitions like the premier league in england you miss the next game suspended if you get a red card or pick up yellow cards during the

unwanted junk mail that arrives in a mailbox such as advertising pamphlets and brochures spam emails are usually sent to try to get the person to buy something or do something else that will cause gain for the sender names the emails sent when someone is spamming is called spam the person or company who sent the unwanted email is called a spammer both of these words came from a brand of canned meat called spam but it was a short sketch created by the british comedy group monty python in that led to the word spam being widely used to mean unwanted email messages uses spam emails are usually sent to many people at once trying to get them to buy a product or sign up for a service the people who receive the email did not ask to receive the email and do not want to receive it one of the reasons there is so much spam emails around is that it costs very little to send millions of spam messages at once spam messages can easily be sent sometimes even by a special computer program how spammers find email addresses the hardest part about spamming is to get the email addresses to send the spam to sometimes the spammers do this by searching for emails on the internet or by buying emails from people who know a lot of them for example someone who runs a site that makes users tell them their email address to signup will have a lot of email addresses to sell to spammers method one one part of getting e mail addresses is to find addresses that are still in use one trick used by spammers is to put a link at the end of a message like this if you do not wish to get more of these messages from us click here to stop getting them if the person clicks on the link it tells the spammers that there is someone at the address then the spammers put that person on a list of people who actually open spam messages next the spammers sell that list to other spammers the same thing happens if the person sends another email back to the spammer called replying which also tells the spammer the message has been opened method two another trick that spammers use is to put a picture even one that cannot be seen into a spam message the picture will have a name that goes with just that one email when the email is opened a request will be sent to the server that has that picture to get the image if they get this request then they know that you read their email which could cause a person to receive even more email spam other meanings the word spamming is also used to describe the act of typing a lot of words or text in internet chat rooms so that other people using the chatroom cannot carry on conversations usually this blocks the screen with meaningless words in order to annoy the other people in the chatroom spamming in internet chatrooms is usually considered to be rude this kind of behavior is usually called flooding rather than spamming the word spam is often mistakenly applied to emails containing content that the receiver sees as silly or simply meaningless e g yujhcykgfvylfuv uyguvgy problems with spam computer users at home and in workplaces waste a lot of time opening and deleting spam messages in some cases spam emails contain viruses or links to pornography or illegal gambling websites spam emails often advertise products or services which are being lied about by the companies sending the spam such as frauds or scams spam prevention some user email programs can automatically delete spam messages when they arrive or move them to a separate spam folder internet service providers also detect them automatically and cooperate to cut off customers who are major spammers damage from the san francisco california earthquake in an earthquake is the shaking of the surface of the earth earthquakes can be extremely violent they are caused by abnormal movements of the earth s tectonic plates the study of earthquakes is called seismology earthquakes are usually quite brief but may repeat the sudden release of tension in the tectonic plates sends waves of energy that travel through the earth seismology studies the cause frequency type and size of earthquakes there are large earthquakes and small earthquakes large earthquakes can take down buildings and cause death and injury earthquakes are measured using observations from seismographs the magnitude of an earthquake and the intensity of shaking is usually reported on the richter scale the richter scale was invented by charles francis richter in on the scale is scarcely noticeable and magnitude or more causes damage over a wide area an earthquake under the ocean can cause a tsunami this can cause just as much death and destruction as the earthquake itself landslides can happen too earthquakes are part of the earth s rock cycle the impact can be measured by a seismometer it detects the vibrations caused by an earthquake it puts these movements on a seismograph the strength or magnitude of an earthquake is measured using the richter scale the richter scale is numbered now the largest ever measured is scientists cannot view a major earthquake beforehand they do know where earthquakes may occur such as close to the fault lines history earthquakes sometimes hit cities and kill hundreds or thousands of people most earthquakes happen along the pacific ring of fire but the biggest ones mostly happen in other places tectonically active places are places where earthquakes or volcanic eruptions are frequent causes of an earthquake earthquakes are caused by tectonic movements in the earth s crust the main cause is when tectonic plates ride one over the other causing orogeny mountain building and severe earthquakes the boundaries between moving plates form the largest fault surfaces on earth when they stick motion between the plates leads to increasing stress this continues until the stress rises and breaks suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault this releases the stored energy as shock waves the san andreas fault in san francisco and rift valley fault in africa are faults like this volcanic earthquakes earthquakes which are caused by volcanic eruptions are quite devastating however these are confined to areas of active volcanoes collapse earthquakes in areas of intense mining activity often the roofs of underground mines collapse and minor tremors take place these are called collapse earthquakes earthquake fault types replica of ancient seismometer with pendulum sensitive to ground tremors in luoyang in ad it detected an earthquake to km to mi away x pxthere are three main types of geological fault that may cause an earthquake normal reverse thrust and strike slip normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened strike slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other earthquake clusters most earthquakes form part of a sequence related to each other in terms of location and time most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors which cause little to no damage but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern a foreshock is an earthquake that occurs before a larger earthquake called the mainshock an aftershock is an earthquake that occurs after a previous earthquake the mainshock an aftershock is in the same region of the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude aftershocks are formed as the crust adjusts to the effects of the main shock earthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period of time they are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is obviously the main shock therefore none have notably higher magnitudes than the other an example of an earthquake swarm is the activity at yellowstone national park sometimes a series of earthquakes occur in a sort of earthquake storm where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters each triggered by the shaking or stress redistribution of the previous earthquakes similar to aftershocks but on adjacent segments of fault these storms occur over the course of years and with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones such a pattern occurred in the north anatolian fault in turkey in the th century tsunami animation of the sendai tsunami tsunami or a chain of fast moving waves in the ocean caused by powerful earthquakes is a very serious challenge for people s safety and for earthquake engineering those waves can inundate coastal areas destroy houses and even swipe away whole towns this is a danger for the whole mankind unfortunately tsunamis can not be prevented however there are warning systems which may warn the population before the big waves reach the land to let them enough time to rush to safety earthquake proofing earthquake proof buildings are constructed to withstand the destructive force of an earthquake this depends upon its type of construction shape mass distribution and rigidity different combinations are used square rectangular and shell shaped buildings can withstand earthquakes better than skyscrapers to reduce stress a building s ground floor can be supported by extremely rigid hollow columns while the rest of the building is supported by flexible columns inside the hollow columns another method is to use rollers or rubber pads to separate the base columns from the ground allowing the columns to shake parallel to each other during an earthquake to help prevent a roof from collapsing builders make the roof out of light weight materials outdoor walls are made with stronger and more reinforced materials such as steel or reinforced concrete during an earthquake

skin especially on their legs their teeth may loosen and or fall out they may bleed from the mouth nose and gums mucus membranes a person with scurvy will look pale and feel sad see depression they will not be able to move easily because their joints hurt scurvy can be easily cured oranges and other fruits can restore vitamins in the past sailors more commonly got scurvy fresh fruit could not be kept for long the main cause of scurvy is lack of fresh fruits and vegetables it is uncommon today signs of scurvy at first a person with scurvy may not want to eat loss of appetite feel sad slight depression lose weight or not get heavier even though they eat a lot have loose feces diarrhea breathe fast tachypnea be hot have a high body temperature or fever a bit later a person with scurvy may feel angry irritability have pains in the legs and tenderness find it hard to move pseudo paralysis have swelling of the arms and legs bleed from the mouth nose and gums why people get scurvy not eating enough food that has vitamin c going on a long trip often at sea where there is no fresh food not having enough food famine breaking down the vitamin c by over cooking like boiling fruit juice treatment of scurvy eating vitamin c pills or giving it by needle injection also known as a shot the injection almost always cures scurvy in babies drinking orange juice is another treatment that works in babies before vitamin c was discovered this was the only treatment when a person gets help for scurvy they usually get better very quickly babies start eating again after one or two days of help the symptoms get better within seven days getting vitamin c from food eating vitamin c prevents scurvy how much vitamin c a person needs changes with his or her age and is different for pregnant and lactating women the following is the food and nutrition board of the national academy of sciences national research council s advice on how much vitamin c to eat every day infants babies mg

cabbage spinach potatoes tomatoes strawberries references an ion is an electrically charged atom or group of atoms it is a part of an atom or part of a group of atoms molecule it is charged so it will move near electricity this is because atoms are made of three smaller parts neutrons with no charge equal numbers of charged protons and oppositely charged electrons an ion has unequal numbers of protons and electrons making an ion from an atom or molecule is called ionization the charge on a proton is measured as positively charged the charge on an electron is measured as negatively charged an atom that is ionized makes two ions one positive and one negatively charged for example a neutral hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron heating the atom breaks it into two parts a positively charged hydrogen ion h a negatively charged electron a liquid with ions is called an electrolyte a gas with lots of ions is called a plasma when ions move it is called electricity for example in a wire the metal ions do not move but the electrons move as electricity a positive ion and a negative ion will move together two ions of the same charge will move apart when ions move they also make magnetic fields many ions are colourless elements in the main groups in the periodic table form colourless ions some ions are coloured the transition metals usually form coloured ions physics in physics atomic nuclei that have been completely ionized are called charged particles these are ones in alpha radiation ionization happens by giving atoms high energy this is done using electrical voltage or by high energy ionizing radiation or high temperature a simple ion is formed from a single atom polyatomic ions are formed from a number of atoms polyatomic ions usually consist of all non metal atoms but sometimes the polyatomic ion can have a metallic atom too positive ions are called cations they are attracted to cathodes negatively charged electrodes cation is pronounced cat eye on not kay shun all simple metal ions are cations negative ions are called anions they are attracted to anodes positively charged electrodes all simple non metal ions except h which is a proton are anions except nh transition metals can form more than one simple cation with different charges most ions have a charge of less than but some can have higher charges michael faraday was the first person to write a theory about ions in in his theory he said what the portions of molecules were like that moved to anions or cations svante august arrhenius showed how this happened he wrote this in his doctoral dissertation in university of uppsala the university did not accept his theory at first he only just passed his degree but in he won the nobel prize in chemistry for the same idea

linguistics the study of language it does not refer to the sum of all these disciplines it refers to their intersection on specific problems anthropology is the study of human beings in greek anthropos means human and logy means study of anthropology is a biological and historical social science that helps us learn how groups of people are the same and how they are different in all parts of the world anthropologists do research in many places and study how people live now and how they may have lived in the past using the study of archaeology they research in modern cities small villages tribes and in the countryside they study how groups of people consider time space life etc applied anthropology is a type of anthropology that uses information discovered using science to help people one recent use of applied anthropology is the return of ancient ways of successful farming to people living in south america another use of applied anthropology is the learning of languages close to dying out and the teaching of young people the language of their ancestors the four big kinds of anthropology are archaeology the study of how people lived in the past archaeologists learn from things people leave behind like pottery stone tools or anything made or used by humans physical anthropology the study of human biology including how people adapt to where they live and how bodies changed over time evolution physical anthropologists also study non human primates linguistic anthropology the study of how people speak and the words they use and how their language developed evolved linguistic anthropology also studies how language changes what people think and how people change language social or cultural anthropology the study of how people live their lives now and how they may have lived in the past including the tools they used and the food they obtained and ate it is also related to sociology and social psychology most people who study anthropology have some schoolwork in all four big kinds of anthropology but later study one or two areas primarily biological anthropology biological anthropology is sometimes taught as a separate

are too large to move the defending side in an air battle can have help from anti aircraft warfare trench warfare during world war i was an example of the advantages of defenders attackers were rarely able to take territory that the enemy defended with the new weapons of the time later armies developed newer weapons and methods and that again allowed them to attack and take even fortified places tanks for example were well protected from machine guns and groups of tanks could move fast enough to avoid being completely destroyed by artillery a country s government may form an army and navy and or an air force to protect the country and its people from attacks the same forces can also attack other countries a country can also use the military to kill or arrest people or members of groups from other countries who have hurt or killed their own citizens education is about teaching learning skills and knowledge it also means helping people to learn how to do things and support them to think about what they learn it s also important for educators to teach ways to find and use information through education the knowledge of society country and of the world is passed on from generation to generation this may include education in morality for example learning how to act as loyal honest and effective citizens education may help and guide individuals from one class to other educated individuals and groups can do things that they help less educated people library reading room of graz university types of education there are different ways to categorize education for example by age or subject one way is to divide it into formal education non formal education and informal education formal education is usually in school where a person may learn basic academic or trade skills small children often attend a nursery or kindergarten but often formal education begins in elementary school and continues with secondary school post secondary education or higher education is usually at a college or university which may grant an academic degree non formal education includes adult basic education adult literacy education or school equivalency preparation in nonformal education someone who is not in school can learn literacy other basic skills or job skills home education individualized instruction such as programmed learning distance learning and computer assisted instruction are other possibilities informal education is less organized it may be a parent teaching a child how to prepare a meal or ride a bicycle people can also get an informal education by reading many books from a library or educational websites this may also be called self education unschooling is basically kids learn as they go and do not go to traditional school buildings rather go on websites play games or engage in normal hobbies and learn along the way this is an alternative to dropping out schooling many public schools provide a free education through the government parents may send their own children to a private schools but they must pay for it in some poorer places some children cannot go to school because their countries do not make education available in their countries or because their families do not have enough money or because the children have to work for money or because the society have negative prejudice on education for girls there are primary schools and secondary schools in many places they are government funded colleges and universities usually charge tuition payments which may be very different in different countries related pages distance education homeschooling education at home special education education of students who have a disability subject school right to education soldiers in an army the army is the part of a country s military that fights on the ground people in the army are called soldiers many modern armies have vehicles such as tanks airplanes and helicopters to help soldiers fight on the ground a soldier may be a volunteer someone who joins something because they want to or he may be forced by the government to join the army forcing men to join the army is called conscription or draft voluntary armies tend to be small by numbers but high in confidence and quality drafted armies are large but often lacking in confidence and in quality it may be very difficult to force someone to risk his life against his will sometimes an army is made up from mercenaries who fight just for pay and have little loyalty to the country which they serve soldiers do many things from shooting enemies to digging defensive trenches they are used to defend their country or attack another country s army it is difficult and soldiers must be in good shape both physically and mentally they almost always move together and that way the team can do more things in a safer way they may be assigned to certain places to guard or they may be told to search a place or even attack it that is up to their commander every soldier answers to someone else so that way everything is organized sometimes when a country s army is busy in different places and there are not enough soldiers to do more a country can hire civilians to do some of the army s jobs like protecting buildings and important people and convoys of trucks traveling from one place to another usually they hire veterans who were members of the military before leaving and working elsewhere working in the army and wearing the uniform is called service a soldier will never say i work as a sergeant in the signal corps but always i serve as a sergeant in the signal corps or other rank specialty and unit only civilian workers who do not wear uniform speak about working in the army discipline the function of the army is based on discipline that means that every soldier will unquestionably carry out the orders which he or she has received and will obey his or her superior officer or non commissioned officer there is only one exception orders which violate the human rights or international law must not be obeyed as it is considered a war crime the chain of command is expressed by the military rank system and hierarchy gear a soldier is supplied with weapons such as guns knives and other simple gear for surviving in the battlefield such as food water clothes and tents they must keep good care of the items some soldiers train to be a doctor for the army or other civilian duties qualifications before a soldier joins the army he must qualify to be in it first the person is put through tests so that the army will know if the recruit can do it or not this is sometimes called boot camp he must complete mental tests and physical tests it depends on where he is testing that will tell him how hard it will be he will also take tests to determine what job he will do in the military for instance he may work with computers and be a member of the signal corps or be a cook for the soldiers he may have been a construction worker in civilian life and be a military engineer he may become a truck driver and serve in logistics or he may be very good with a rifle and be a sniper in the infantry there are a lot of jobs that a person can choose to do in the army branches there are traditionally six branches of service in the army infantry foot soldiers who fight with rifles and other light weapons cavalry mounted soldiers today tank has replaced horses and cavalrymen are called tankers artillery soldiers who operate cannons howitzers and mortars they provide fire support for infantry military engineers soldiers who build things and demolish blow up things and handle explosives signal corps soldiers who operate communications radios radars signaling and computers logistics which carry supplies food fuel ammunition medicines etc to other branches

theology is called a theologian books or ideas about theology are called theological theology may be studied for many reasons some people study theology to better understand their own religion while other people study theology so that they can compare religions the word theology was first used to describe the study of god in christianity but some now use it to describe the study of religion generally but not everyone agrees that it is right to do so some people use the words comparative theology in reference to approaching theology within more than one religion at once during the high middle ages it was thought that theology was the highest subject learned in universities theology at that time was named the queen of the sciences there was a plan for young men to study easy subjects and then harder subjects the easiest subjects were called the trivium the next harder subjects were called the quadrivium finally young men were expected to study theology this meant that the other subjects existed primarily to help with theological thought other websites http www queensu ca religion theology html romania old spelling rumania roumania is a country in southeastern europe it is

defeated by the persian emperor darius the great when he battled the scythians the getae were called the dacians by the romans they were thracians who were living in dacia which is where romania moldova and the northern part of bulgaria are now the dacians attacked the roman province the border of which was formed by the danube in this was during emperor domitian s rule the dacians were defeated by the roman empire under emperor trajan in two battles that lasted from until the roman empire made dacia into the province of roman dacia a lot of ore such as gold and silver were found in roman dacia a lot of gold and silver were found in the western carpathians trajan went back to rome with tons pounds of gold and tons pounds of silver after his conquest there were many romans living in the province of roman dacia they spoke vulgar latin they began to write the local languages using the latin alphabet writing languages with the latin alphabet is called romanization this became the first version of romanian in the rd century the province was attacked by groups of nomadic people like the goths they made the roman empire leave dacia about this became the roman empire s first

turned into the principality of transylvania this lasted until wallachia had been on the border of the ottoman empire since the th century as the ottoman empire s influence grew it gradually fell under the suzerainty control of the ottoman empire in the th century the best known ruler of this period was vlad iii the impaler also known as vlad dracula or prince of wallachia during the years of and while he was the leader of his people he had an agreement with the ottoman empire to stay independent many people in romania during this time thought of him as a ruler with a great sense of justice and defense for his country moldavia was at its greatest when stephen the great was ruling between and he was a great military leader winning battles and losing only after every battle he won

and feelings into romania and became called national awakening of romania even then adopted a colored flag blue yellow red which was later to become a flag of romania after the even more violent revolution of did not succeed so explained the great powers did not like the idea of romania becoming a free nation and it was not a real possibility the people who voted in in moldavia and wallachia picked the same person alexandru ioan cuza to be the prince in those areas he managed to unite the people and nationalism was seen as a useful method alexandru ioan cuza walked with cautious steps he was not proclaiming a declaration of independence immediately because he knew it would bring a new war instead he let moldavia and wallachia merged in the united principalities of the ottoman empire and increasing self government to a greater degree the new union was at the front of today s romania with cautious steps we freed itself more and bucharest was established as the capital however

largely agricultural country during communism the country had planned economy the transition from planned economy to a market economy after the communist regime led to economic collapse in the s the reasons was that more money was printed expensive prices and substantial privatization of the companies which initially leads to skyrocketing unemployment the reforms in the s allowed foreign investors for the first time to buy land in romania when it was going explosively good for the industry in the latin countries such as france italy and spain these countries began to trade with

community eec it has created a common economic area with europe wide laws allowing the citizens of eu countries to move and trade in other eu countries almost the same as they do in their own nineteen of these countries also share the same type of money the euro the treaty of lisbon is the most recent treaty that says how the union is run every member state signed to say that they each agreed with what it says most importantly it says which jobs powers the union should do for the members and which jobs they should do themselves the members decide how the union should act by voting for or against proposals the objective of the eu is to bring its member states closer together with respect of human rights and democracy it does this with a common style of passport common rules about fair trading with each other common agreements about law enforcement and other agreements most members share a common currency the euro and most allow people to travel from one country to another without having to show a passport history quai d orsay paris robert schuman gave the speech starting the plan for a european coal and steel community in after world war ii the countries in europe wanted to live peacefully together and help one another s economies instead of fighting each other for coal and steel the first member countries west germany france italy belgium netherlands and luxembourg created one european coal and steel community in in in the italian city of rome the member countries signed another treaty and made the european economic community now it was a community for coal steel and for trade later it changed the name to the european community in with the treaty of maastricht it changed its name to the european union now the member countries work together not only in politics and economy coal steel and trade but also in money justice laws and foreign affairs with the schengen agreement member countries of the eu opened their borders to each other so people can now travel from one country to the other without a passport or identity card now already member countries have replaced their national currencies with the euro new countries became members of the eu in more became members in and more in today there are member countries altogether free movement a person who is a citizen of a european union country can live and work in any of the other member countries without needing a work permit or visa for example a french person can move to greece to work there or just to live there and he or she does not need permission from an authority in greece in the same way products made in one member country can be sold in any other member country without any special permissions or extra taxes for this reason the members agree rules on product safety they

the council of the european union is the main decision making group the cabinet ministers of the member countries meet ministers for foreign affairs for agriculture for justice etc and discuss issues that are important to them before the treaty of lisbon written in implemented in each member state takes a turn at being president of the council for six months for example from january until july germany held the presidency the six months before that finland held the presidency now the president of the european union chairs the council summits the president of the council is the organiser and manager and is voted into office for a duration of two and a half years he or she does not have the power to make decisions about the european union like the president of the united states does for that country member countries with a large population germany france united kingdom etc have more votes than countries with small populations luxembourg malta etc but a decision cannot be made if enough countries vote against the decision twice a year the heads of government prime ministers and or the heads of state presidents meet to talk about the main issues and make decisions on different issues this meeting is different and not as formal it is known as a european council note this is not the same thing as the council of europe which is not part of the european union european commission the european commission runs the day to day running of the eu and writes laws like a government laws written by the commission are discussed and changed by the european parliament and the council of the european union the commission has one president and commissioners selected by the european council the commission president is appointed by the european council with the approval of the european parliament the commission operates like a cabinet government there is one commissioner per member state though commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the eu as a whole rather than their home state european parliament the parliament is the only directly elected body the parliament has a total of members called members of the european parliament or mep they are elected in their countries every five years by the citizens of the european union member countries the parliament can approve reject or change proposed laws it can also sack the european commission in that case the entire commission would have to give up their jobs politics there are many discussions in the eu about how it should develop and change in the future the main reasons why european countries came together are political and economic the need to prevent another european war after world war i and world war ii the need to respect human rights rule of law and democracy more affirmed by council of europe the need to have a common economic area member states in six countries made the european coal and steel community a basic version of what the eu is now these six then went further and in they made the european economic community and the european coal and steel community the uk and others decided not to join and then when the uk changed its mind it was stopped from joining by french president charles de gaulle when he was no longer president the uk and others started to join today there are members but the idea that more should join is not seen as a good one by everyone the member states of the european union highlighted in light brown founders in later just germany joined in joined in left in joined in joined in joined in joined in joined in serbia montenegro the republic of macedonia turkey and iceland are candidate countries they are being considered for membership albania bosnia and herzegovina and kosovo are expected to follow however since there have been many political problems happening in turkey recently especially with president erdogan s arresting of tens of thousands of political rivals since the failed coup attempt on july it is unlikely that it would be allowed to part of the eu anytime soon because eu members believe that the current turkish government is not respecting human rights rule of law or democracy motto united in diversity or

greeks were one of the most advanced civilizations greece is famous for its many philosophers like plato and aristotle and kings like alexander the great and leonidas greece is said to be the birthplace of democracy because city states like athens now the capital of greece were the first to elect their leaders and not have kings during the years of alexander the great a huge macedonian empire was created that stretched from modern day greece to egypt and iran until the borders of india because of the significant role that greek culture played during that time it is called the hellenistic period or greek dominated period during that time the greek language became the lingua franca of the middle east which means the language that people who do not speak the same language use to communicate like english is used today as an international language greece was then ruled by the roman empire and many argue that rome conquered greece with its army but greece conquered rome with its culture the roman empire after the conquest of greece became a civilization known as the greco roman or greek roman civilization when the roman empire collapsed the greeks emerged as the ruling class of the byzantine empire and the greek language became the official language of the empire which included all the territories around the eastern mediterranean sea it was then occupied by the

in both world war i and world war ii in the side of allies during world war i greece was divided into two countries the state of thessaloniki in the north and the state of athens in the south both countries claimed to be the legitimate government of greece but the state of thessaloniki received support from the allies the country was reunited in when the king abdicated in greece expanded again and briefly reached its maximum size the territories that the country had gained in turkey were given back to turkey in the treaty of lausanne but greece kept western thrace greece was under a fascist dictatorship from until when it was invaded by nazi germany in greece was invaded by italy but defeated the invasion this was the first victory of an allied country against an axis power after this hitler decided to attack greece sooner than he had planned germany invaded on april and captured greece s second largest city of thessaloniki on april while athens was captured on april most fighting ended with the battle of crete greece suffered major damages in the war between and the greeks fought a civil war the fighting was between the communists and the people who supported the king who also had support from the united kingdom and the united states the war left the country devastated and the people very poor in the military took control of the country and restricted democracy free

federal state like the united states but a unitary state like the united kingdom it is ruled by a parliament called the hellenic parliament or greek parliament in simple english which has members it

blue field was used as a land flag within greece from until and from to in the current flag became national flag and the older land flag was abolished there are many theories about the origin of the color of the flag one says that the blue represents the color of the sea and the white represents the waves and others include white for the waves and blue for the sky and white for purity and breakaway from tyranny and blue for greece there are nine stripes on the flag which according to the legend represent the nine syllables in the phrase which means freedom or death the cross stands for
